"Oat (Avena sativa L.) beta-glucan is bound tightly to other components of the endosperm cell wall, which means that beta-glucan extraction processes are complex and involve many different stages. Subcritical-water extraction (SWE) has emerged as a promising method for extracting beta-glucan under high temperature and pressure conditions. This study investigated the efficiency of the SWE of beta-glucan from oat flour. The yield of beta-glucan was optimized under the following conditions: extraction temperature of 200 degrees C, solvent pH of 4.0, extraction time of 10 min, and particle size of 425-850 mu m. The extraction yield under the optimal condition was 6.98 +/- 1.17 g/100 g oat flour, which was more than twofold higher than when using hot-water extraction at 60 degrees C for 3 h. beta-glucan degradation to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde was increased under high-temperature conditions. SWE is a feasible alternative for extracting beta-glucan in a single-step process, and could be developed into an effective industrial process.",1,99,99,1,1,99,2,0,0,3,155
"The physiological functionality of cereal beta-glucan (beta-glucan) has been mainly attributed to its ability to form viscous solutions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The viscosity is dependent on the concentration, extractability and molecular weight of beta-glucan, and to enable maximal functionality, these factors should therefore be acknowledged and their role in the physiological functionality of cereal beta-glucan further studied. An in vitro GI simulation with separate oral, gastric and small intestine phases was used to model the state of beta-glucan from various oat products in the GI tract. A rather large variation (from 26% to 99%) was observed in the extractabilities between product categories, with the highest extractabilities observed in spoonable products. The viscosities also varied highly within categories. When the comparison was done at similar concentration levels, the highest viscosities were observed in the products produced through dry processes, and moisture content during processing was suggested to be essential to the extent of beta-glucan degradation. The viscosity in samples that were likely to exhibit enzymatic activity was shown to be rather low, and thus the physiological functionality of beta-glucan may be threatened if the product also contains grain ingredients other than kiln-dried oat. Clear differences were observed in the functionality of beta-glucan in the GI tract model depending on a product type, and these were explained by differences in ingredients and processes. However, further studies are needed to specify the influence of each factor and to clarify the factors determining the physiological functionality of beta-glucan in food products.",2,0,99,1,0,0,1,0,3,1,249
"Due to their high content of beta-glucan, the consumption of oat products can contribute to a healthy diet. Roasting may improve sensory properties but could also affect the nutritional value of oat products. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyse the impact of different roasting conditions (140-180 degrees C, approx. 20 min) on sensory quality, health-related compounds (e.g. acrylamide, beta-glucan) and viscosities of oat kernels and flakes. Roasting resulted in oat flakes with improved sensory properties. Acrylamide formation increased with higher roasting temperatures in kernels, thin and thick flakes. Contents of fat, protein, starch and beta-glucan were not affected by roasting, whereas dietary fibre fractions were marginally modulated. Viscosities were significantly reduced with increasing roasting temperatures. The results indicate that roasting up to 160 degrees C is a processing technique with potential to generate oat products with improved sensory quality and favourable nutritional composition.",3,1,1,99,1,1,4,0,0,1,147
"Solid-state fermentation (SSF) is the preferred method of enhancing the phenolic content of oats, while scientific optimization for improving specific phenolic compounds is limited. In this study, sequential targeting of phenolic conversion in simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) of oats was investigated. The results revealed that SHF with adding cellulase at 0, 6 and 12 days could increase the total phenolic content by 4.4%, 67.8% and 59.1%, respectively, over that of SSF. The a-amylase and CMCase activity were highly correlated with the soluble and insoluble phenolic contents in SHF (-6 and -12) systems (r > 0.8, p < 0.05). Interestingly, the content of phenolic fraction, such as ferulic acid, was up-regulated, whereas sinapic acid was down-regulated. These results indicated that the phenolic conversion occurred in SHF, resulting in variation in DPPH and ABTS(+) radical scavenging abilities. This research provided metabolic understanding of the optimization of phenolic compounds to increase the functional ingredient of oats.",4,1,99,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,154
"In early-weaning programs, dietary effects on calf rumen development have been studied extensively, but very little information is available about the effects of a solid diet on hepatic metabolism in preweaned dairy calves. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of physical form of oats in calf starter on the expression of key hepatic gluconeogenic, beta-oxidation, and acute phase protein genes in preweaned dairy calves. Samples were analyzed from 3 experiments that fed either ground or whole oats in calf starters. Briefly, 7 calves were slaughtered at 5 wk of age in experiment 1, 6 were slaughtered at 6 wk in experiment 2, and 7 were slaughtered at 7 wk in experiment 3, and liver tissue was collected for gene expression analysis. Calves from experiments 1 and 2 were cannulated, and their rumen pH and volatile fatty acids were measured during treatment periods. The mRNA expression of gluconeogenic enzymes pyruvate carboxylase (PC), cytosolic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1 and PCK2), fatty acid oxidation enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), and positive acute phase protein haptoglobin (HPT) was measured by real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Expression of RPT was greater in calves fed whole oats than in calves fed ground oats; however, PC, PCK1, PCK2, and CPT1 were not affected by the physical form of oats. All enzymes (PCK1, PCK2, HPT, and CPT1) except PC were affected by experiment; PCK1 and CPT1 had greater expression in experiment 2 than in experiments 1 and 3. Expression of PCK2 was similar in experiments 2 and 3 but greater than experiment 1. Expression of HPT was similar in experiments 1 and 2 but greater than experiment 3. The mRNA expression of enzymes PCK1, PCK2, and CPT1 differed between experiments 1 and 2 and was negatively correlated with rumen propionate and butyrate but had a positive relationship with rumen acetate. Similarly, rumen pH was different in experiments 1 and 2, averaging 5.69 in experiment 1 and 4.81 in experi",5,0,1,-1,99,0,1,1,2,1,325
"This study was carried out to investigate storage-associated changes in the fatty acid profile (with GC and H-1-NMR techniques) of oat-based gluten-free cookies prepared with different fats: margarine (MAR), butter (BUT), lard (LAR), refined palm oil (RPO), refined palm oil with stearin (RPOS), and hydrogenated palm oil (HPO). GC analysis indicated that palmitic and stearic acid were the predominant saturated fatty acids (SFAs), regardless of the type of fat used. cis-Oleic acid represented the major monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), while cis-linoleic acid was the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). After 6 months of storage, a significant decreasing trend in SFA concentration was observed for LAR and RPOS cookies, while a decrease in MUFA concentration was observed only for HPO cookies. In fresh cookies and in cookies stored for 6 months, the contents of SFA, MUFA, and PUFA determined by GC were positively correlated with those determined by H-1-NMR (r > 0.90).",6,99,0,0,99,0,0,0,3,2,152
") added, to analyse the effect of the chemical structure due to the fructan-type added. For doughs, it was found that AF lowered the water adsorption, causing a short development time and the highest stability during kneading. The texture profile analysis and rheological tests revealed that AF increased springiness and cohesiveness. For cookies, the crumb and lightness were evaluated using a computer vision system. Among the samples, AF promoted a darker and shiny crust and a more homogeneous and compact microstructure. X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that AF had the highest values of crystallinity. In order to provide more information about the distribution of carbohydrates (aldoses and ketoses) and gluten proteins in the cookies, a method was developed to specifically stain these molecules, and it successfully described the effect of the fructans incorporated into doughs and cookies. Results from confocal laser scanning microscopy illustrated differences in the distribution of the biopolymers stained. This research provided an improved understanding of the AF addition on the technological properties and the structure-functionally relationship of doughs and cookies, beyond the nutraceutical applications attributed to the AF.",7,0,1,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,181
"Many pesticides are used for pest control during oat production and storage, making necessary to employ multiclass methods for pesticide residue determination. In this work, an efficient QuEChERS method was established for multiresidue determination of 60 pesticides in oats by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Different sorbents, such as chitosan, Forisil (R), C18, PSA, Supel QuE Z-Sep+, and EMR-Lipid were evaluated for cleanup by dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE). The original QuEChERS method had the best performance and the biosorbent chitosan presented similar results to the other conventional sorbents evaluated and being an efficient and low-cost biodegradable material was chosen for the cleanup step. The method presented adequate accuracy and precision using blank samples spiked between 5 and 100 mu g kg(-1), with recovery from 70 to 120% and RSD <20% for all 60 pesticides and limits of quantification of 5 <mu>g kg(-1) for almost all studied pesticides, with exception of triflumizole for which was 10 mu g kg(-1). The method was successfully applied in real samples proven to be a good option for routine analysis. Oat samples presented residues of azoxystrobin, metalaxyl, and thiamethoxam.",8,1,99,0,1,99,2,0,1,2,186
"Several processing techniques can be used to slow the degradation rate in the rumen and thus provide more bypass crude protein (CP) and starch to the small intestine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of processing methods on cool-season adapted oat grain compared with dry-rolled barley grain, when fed as total mixed ration (TMR) for lactating dairy cows. Eight lactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods and fed TMR with 1 of 4 treatments: dry-rolled oats, steam-flaked oats, pelleted oats, or dry-rolled barley. Dry matter intake (DMI) ranged from 28.19 to 31.61 kg/d and was lower for rolled oats compared with pelleted oats. Despite the nutrient intake being higher for cows fed pelleted oats, those fed rolled oats had the highest milk production and milk fat percentage (49.23 kg/d and 4%, respectively). Ruminal fermentation characteristics were similar across treatments, with only significant differences in concentrations of acetate (lowest for pelleted oats) and total short-chain fatty acids (highest value for rolled barley) and a lower pH for flaked oats at the 9-h and 12-h points. Dietary treatments did not affect total-tract digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, or CP; digestibility of starch was the lowest for rolled barley (89.04%). Measured blood metabolites, urea, glucose, and beta-hydroxybutyrate, were not affected by dietary treatment. Purine derivatives and microbial N supply were also unaffected by dietary treatments. Cows fed flaked oat-based TMR showed the lowest N excretion in milk; however, the lack of difference between diets with regard to urinary N and fecal N excretion resulted in no significant changes in N balance between diets. Therefore, rolled oats allow cows to have higher milk production with lower DMI compared with all other treatments in this study.",9,0,0,99,99,1,1,0,2,2,296
"Protein-enriched gluten-free pasta was prepared from oat starch-rich endosperm (SRE), which was substituted with different proportions of oat protein concentrate (OPC) and/or faba protein concentrate (FPC) fractions in order to obtain a similar protein content (18% and 35%). Accordingly, the health claims 'source of protein' and 'high protein' were achieved. Pasta with OPC and FPC had lower optimal cooking time (8 and 6.3 min), cooking loss (6% and 10.2% dm) and water absorption (152% and 147%) than control SRE pasta (9.3 min; 12.3% dm and 185%). Addition of protein concentrates produced an increase in hardness and chewiness of spaghetti. The glycaemic index of pasta was lowered by the addition of protein ingredients, the lowest value being achieved with FPC. In vitro protein digestibility of pasta increased up to 3.5% for OPC and up to 7.1% in case of FPC addition. The most protein-digestible pasta was that with FPC addition to reach 35% protein content.",10,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,154
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic potential and the viability in fermented oat dairy beverage of Lactobacillus curvatus isolate P99. Probiotic potential was assessed through the survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, autoaggregation, coaggregation, and hydrophobicity capacity and antimicrobial activity. The safety aspects of the isolate were evaluated for application in food, and these were determined by phenotypic and genotypic tests. Isolate P99 was able to survive in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions and showed hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and coaggregation with Listeria monocytogenes. Moreover, the isolate and its cell free supernatant showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. L. curvatus P99 showed in vitro probiotic potential, fulfilled safety aspects, and remained viable for 35 days in fermented oat dairy beverage stored at 4 degrees C. Moreover, probiotic fermented oat dairy beverage demonstrated high acceptability. Therefore, isolate P99 can be considered a promising microorganism for the manufacture of probiotic foods. Practical applications Probiotics are microorganisms capable of providing health benefits to the host. However, isolates with probiotic potential from foods, when used as adjuvant cultures in foods, promote desirable sensory attributes and ensure microbiologically safe food. In this study, we found that Lactobacillus curvatus P99 presented probiotic potential and remains viable for 35 days when used in the production of fermented oat dairy beverage. Therefore, isolate P99 can be considered a promising microorganism for the manufacture of probiotic foods.",11,99,1,99,1,1,3,0,0,2,231
"Purpose The enrichment of bread with non-digestible prebiotic ingredients may exert health-promoting effects and provide healthier food choices for those suffering from metabolic diseases, including obesity and diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of ss-glucan and resistant starch incorporation on the glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) of white bread. Design/methodology/approach Seven different formulations of prebiotic bread were produced using different proportions of ss-glucan (0.8, 1 and 1.2 per cent), resistant starch (5.5, 8 and 10.5 per cent) and the combination of resistant starch and ss-glucan in a ratio of 4:0.5. Findings The GI and GL of the prebiotic bread prepared with 1 per cent ss-glucan (w/w) were 55.7 and 7.8, respectively, whereas those of the prebiotic bread prepared with 8 per cent resistant starch (w/w) were 64.8 and 8.42, respectively, with both breads having significantly lower GI and GL values than the control (P < 0.05). It was concluded that the incorporation of 1 per cent ss-glucan may be beneficial in producing prebiotic bread with both low GI and low GL. Originality/value Although white bread is a main food source in human diet, its high GI and GL make it an unhealthy food choice. The incorporation of ingredients with prebiotic effects, such as ss-glucan and resistant starch, can improve the nutritional value of this product by lowering its GI and GL.",12,1,1,-1,1,1,4,1,0,0,228
"), typical for viscoelastic materials such as gels and dispersions. The incorporation of 0.1% kappa-carrageenan into milk dessert with different oat gum concentrations allows to obtain stronger gel structure compared to milk dessert with separate oat gum addition. It can be also observed that desserts systems with the 0.1% kappa-carrageenan had more stable viscoelastic properties. Moreover, the use the kappa-carrageenan addition caused an increase in consistency coefficient (K) and decreased in n-value for Ostwald de Waele rheological model. Combined addition of oat gum and carrageenan allows to obtain milk dessert with stronger texture. The hardness of milk desserts range from 0.32 to 0.49 N for desserts without kappa-carrageenan addition and from 0.513 to 0.557 N for desserts with kappa-carrageenan. The high synergistic effect of composed gum mixtures on rheological properties of milk dessert occurs at 0.1% oat gum and 0.1% kappa-carrageenan concentration.",13,1,99,1,0,0,2,0,2,1,142
"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most important mycotoxins due to its widespread occurrence and toxicity, including nephrotoxicity and potential carcinogenicity to humans. OTA has been detected in a wide range of agricultural commodities and their processed products such as infant cereals and breakfast cereals. Extrusion processing, which is widely used in the manufacture of infant and breakfast cereals, may reduce mycotoxin levels to varying degrees. Hence, the effects of extrusion cooking process on the stability of OTA in spiked (100 mu g/kg) oat flakes and rice flour was investigated by using a laboratory-scaled twin-screw extruder. In addition, the effect of twin-screw extrusion and addition of baking soda (0, 0.5, and 1.0% weight of total solids) on the reduction of OTA in oats and rice was investigated. The reductions of OTA in the artificially contaminated oat flakes upon extrusion cooking were in the range of 40-43% whereas the reductions in rice flour ranged from 78 to 82%. The reductions of OTA during extrusion with added baking soda were up to 65% and 72% in oats and rice, respectively. These results suggest that OTA in rice and oats may be reduced significantly by extrusion cooking process, which can be applied to commercial production of infant cereals and breakfast cereals. In addition, baking soda may also help to reduce OTA levels in oats during thermal processing.",14,-1,-1,1,1,99,2,2,0,1,225
"In general, the interest in food that contains a reasonable amount of plant protein is steadily increasing. As a consequence, products with pleasant texture and taste ensuring a high consumer acceptance are needed. The aim of the present study was to develop and characterize structural differences and organoleptic impressions of lactic acid fermented, oat-based gels which could serve as plant protein enriched, non-dairy yoghurt alternatives. Oat protein concentrate, a by-product of cereal processing, was used as plant protein source. It was shown that total solids content had the highest impact on rheological properties. All samples were described as soft fluid gels and their structure was dominated by the heat-induced gelation of starch. Within this mixed food system of starch and protein, swollen starch granules, protein aggregates and residual small fat droplets were embedded in a rough macromolecular network of leached amylose. They acted as filler and increased the rigidity (G') of the system. Native starch content determined the water holding capacity with an increase in water binding with increasing concentration. Overall, rheological characteristics were found to be strongly linked to the products' textural attributes which, in turn, determined consumer acceptability. For the purpose of product development, overall liking was influenced by the quantifiable sensory attributes - sweet, moist, soft, and smooth. Purchase intention, however, was positively influenced by the extrinsic attribute information (on oat protein enrichment). These data, in combination with the impact of the identified ingredients on product structure, are a valuable tool to improve product properties, consumer perceptions and product acceptability. To conclude, lactic fermented, oat-based gels can serve as a plant-based yoghurt-alternative that combines nutritional benefits with good textural properties.",15,1,1,1,99,1,4,0,0,1,273
"The present study investigated the effects of proteins, lipids and beta-glucan in naked oat flour (NOF) on the in vitro digestibility of starch. The content of rapidly digested starch (RDS) increased, and the content of resistant starch (RS) decreased in NOF after removing the non-starch constituents. The estimated glycemic index (eGI) of starch in NOF increased after the removal of the non-starch constituents, with a decreasing order of naked oat starch (NOS) > de-beta-glucan flour > de-proteins flour > de-lipids flour > NOF. NOS was found to have an A-type crystalline pattern, but the removal of proteins or beta-glucan rendered NOS a V-type crystalline pattern. The relative crystallinity decreased after removing non-starch constituents. The in vitro digestibility was positively correlated with the short-range molecular order and negatively correlated with the relative crystallinity. These results clearly illustrate the effects of non-starch constituents on the low digestibility of naked oat.",16,0,-1,1,-1,1,2,2,1,0,148
"The process of maceration of oats is still little explored; however, this stage is of great importance for malting, because the moisture content required for the synthesis of enzymes in the germination phase influences the quality of the product obtained. This research aimed at studying the influence of different temperature of hydration of the URS CORONA oat grain on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties. Also, the composition and morphology of oat grain were evaluated. The physicochemical analyses resulted in contents of 9.96% protein, 4.60% lipids, and 40.8% starch. The hydration isotherms (10, 20, 25, and 35 degrees C) presented two hydration phases characterized by capillary forces (Phase I) and the diffusion phenomenon (Phase II). The adjustments of the Peleg model and Second Fick Law to data experiment were satisfactory. Results showed the mass transfer constants increased to temperature addition. Thermodynamic parameters showed that the maceration oat process presents lower activation energy; it is an exothermic and not spontaneous process. Practical Applications Kinetics model can provide information about the moisture in the oat grain during the soaking process with practical application to the starch, malt, and flour industries. Thermodynamic properties can be used to optimize grain processing parameters as time and temperature, and to reduce the maceration operation.",17,99,99,99,0,0,0,0,2,3,207
"The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence and formation of peroxygenase catalysed non-volatile oxidised fatty acids (NVOFAs), especially epoxy and hydroxy fatty acids, which potentially provide off-flavours in oat. A method based on extraction of NVOFAs using accelerated solvent extraction and analysis by UHPLC-ELSD/MS was developed. Hydroxy and epoxy fatty acids from oleic and linoleic acids were present as major NVOFAs in non-heat treated (NHT) oat products, and the contents increased markedly during storage. In a controlled storage experiment, NVOFA contents in NHT oat flours increased to 1700-2000 mu g/g, whereas in heat-treated samples, only to 200-400 mu g/g. Epoxy fatty acids seemed to be the first products that occurred, followed by hydroxy fatty acids and minor NVOFAs. The formation of NVOFAs was related to lipase catalysed lipid hydrolysis and the formation of volatile lipid oxidation products. Inactivation of lipid degrading enzymes is crucial to producing stable oat products.",18,0,99,0,0,99,0,0,3,2,152
"Inadequate dietary fiber intake contributes to irregular bowel movements and may contribute to difficulty with defecation in children. Whole grain foods, such as oatmeal, may improve stool consistency and stool frequency in children; however, no studies have examined its effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate if 2 weeks of oatmeal consumption in children (ages 7-12 years) increases stool frequency, improves stool consistency, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. In this single-arm intervention study, children who reported <= 5 bowel movements per week during screening, consumed two servings of instant oatmeal daily for 2 weeks. The primary outcome was stool frequency and secondary outcomes included stool consistency and GI symptoms. Participants recorded bowel movements daily, food intake, and GI symptoms during baseline and 2 intervention weeks. Photos of the children's stool were taken at three timepoints during the study to assess stool consistency. In total, 33 children (15 female and 18 male) completed the study. Linear mixed models were used to detect change between baseline and the intervention weeks and accounted for repeated measures within subjects. No statistical differences in stool frequency or consistency were observed between the intervention weeks vs. baseline; however, dietary fiber intake significantly increased during the 2 weeks of oatmeal consumption (P = .008). The addition of oatmeal to children's diets is an effective way to increase fiber consumption and may reduce some GI symptoms such as gas, straining, and feeling of incomplete evacuation.

"Purpose Beta-glucans are biologically active polysaccharides having antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and antiinflammatory properties. This study investigated the transcriptomic profile in peripheral blood of rats with LPS-induced enteritis, which were fed a diet supplemented with high- (G1) and low- (G2) molecular-weight oat beta-glucans. Methods Two-color rat gene expression microarrays were applied and the analysis was performed using a common reference design to provide easy means of comparing samples from various experimental conditions against one another. Common reference sample was labeled with cyanine 3 (Cy3) and investigated samples from each experimental group: C-G0 (control group fed semi-synthetic diet), LPS-G0 (LPS-challenged group fed semi-synthetic diet), LPS-G1 (LPS-challenged group fed G1 beta-glucan enriched diet), and LPS-G2 (LPS-challenged group fed G2 beta-glucan enriched diet) were labeled with cyanine 5 (Cy5). Each microarray was performed in quadruplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc test (p < 0.05). A multiple testing correction was performed using Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate < 5%. A quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed to verify the expression of chosen transcripts. Results The microarray analyses revealed differentially expressed transcripts between: the LPS-G0 and the control groups: C-G0 (138 genes), the LPS-G1 and LPS-G0 groups (533 genes), and the LPS-G2 and LPS-G0 groups (97 genes). Several differentially expressed genes in the beta-glucan-supplemented groups encoded proteins belonging to TLR and NLR signaling pathways, as well as prostaglandin synthesis and regulation pathways. Both beta-glucans up-regulated the expression of Atg10, which belongs to the family of autophagy-related genes, suggesting a possible link between autophagy induction and beta-glucan supplementation. Conclusion The changes in gene expression observed in the peripheral blood indicate that oat beta-glucans exerted a protective effect",20,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,275
"This study investigated the in vitro digestive behavior of different processed oat products using a dynamic rat stomach and duodenum model. The changes in gastric emptying with respect to digestion time, glucose concentration, estimated glycemic index (GI), rheological and microstructural properties of the gastric and duodenal digests were determined. The results showed that the digesta viscosity of oatmeal (OM), oat wowo (OW), oat paste (OP) and oat rice (OR) decreased faster than unprocessed oat (UO) during digestion. Glucose concentration and gastric emptying increased with decreasing viscosity of oat products digesta at each digestion time. OR and OP had a higher gastric emptying rates and glucose concentration as compared to UO, OM and OW. The estimated GI of UO, OM and OW were lower than 55 and belonged to low GI food. The porous structures of oat products observed indicated that thermal treatments can change the digestion characteristics of oat products.",21,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,150
"The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effects of mulberry leaf and oat bran on type 2 diabetes. Co-treatment of diabetic mice with mulberry leaf and oat bran for 28 days led to lower glucose level and better glucose tolerance capacity than either mulberry leaf or oat bran treatment. It was found that this combination resulted in more significant inhibitory effects on alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities. Meanwhile, the enhancement on insulin receptor and glucokinase expressions and down-regulation on pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex kinase expressions were also observed. Additionally, the combination increased the gut microbiota diversity, and reshaped the gut microbiota structure. Based on the above data, it is more feasible to affirm that the combined supplementation of mulberry leaf and oat bran is a potential adjuvant on the treatment of diabetes mellitus.",22,1,1,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,141
"BACKGROUND During the industrial production of beta-glucan, a protein-rich fraction remains as a by-product. Recovery of this protein as oat protein concentrate (OPC) results in a source of cereal protein for food and improves the overall economy of the process. In this study, a yoghurt-type product is developed by lactic acid fermentation of an OPC suspension after subjection to heat treatment to assure starch gelatinization. RESULTS In detail, the process of yoghurt production involved an initial heating step to 90 degrees C, followed by 24 h fermentation with a starter culture consisting of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus und Streptococcus thermophilus. The resulting yoghurt-type product was mildly sour (pH 4.2) with a certain amount of lactic acid (3.3 +/- 0.2 g kg(-1)) and contained 4.9 x 10(6) cfu g(-1) lactobacillus after 24 h fermentation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a porous network presumably built up from the gelatinized starch fraction containing aggregated structures, between which were assumed to be aggregated oat proteins. Moreover, to a limited extent, proteolysis occurred during fermentation. Thus some of the proteolytic enzymes present in the yoghurt culture cleaved oat protein and released peptides. However, the effect on essential amino acids was small. CONCLUSION The results of this study provide a deeper knowledge into the role of starch and protein in fermented OPC yoghurts. The structure of fermented OPC verifies the applicability of oat protein as an alternative source for yoghurt-type products. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",23,1,1,99,0,1,3,0,1,1,240
"The biggest challenge in the production of gluten-free baked products is creating a structure without gluten while maintaining physicochemical and sensory properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of applying oat beta-glucan as the thickening and structure-making agent instead of xanthan (control sample), due to its pro-health technological properties, in yeast-leavened gluten-free cake. Thus, high-in-beta-glucan oat fibre powder was incorporated into cake formulations as 5, 10, 15 and 20% replacement of rice or corn flour. The complex analysis of physicochemical and sensory properties was conducted, where texture and rheological aspects were the most important. An analysis of the correlation between rheological and physical properties was also conducted. Corn and rice cakes differed, but the results showed the increase of beta-glucan, total dietary fibre, springiness, cohesiveness, storage (G ') and loss (G '') modulus and the decrease of firmness and lightness. Improvement of porosity and volume was also noticed. Significant correlation was observed among G ', G '', specific volume and texture components. Accelerated texture changes were noticed after 24 h of storage. To sum up, it is justified to incorporate oat fibre into gluten-free baked products, both to increase nutritional value and improve cake structure.",24,0,1,0,1,1,3,0,2,0,199
"The control of Salmonella in low water activity foods poses a challenge for the food industry because of its thermal resistance. The use of surrogate bacteria in a food plant is considered a critical component to validate processing steps. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8042, a generally recognized as safe bacterium (GRAS), as potential surrogate for Salmonella in commercial toasted oats cereal (TOC) and peanut butter. P. acidilactici was compared to a five-serovar cocktail of Salmonella and Enterococcus faecium NRRL-B2354, separately. Cultures were inoculated into TOC and thermal kinetic parameters (delta, beta) were determined at 80, 85, 90, and 95 degrees C using the Weibull model. In peanut butter, delta and beta parameters were obtained at 63, 68, 73, and 77 degrees C. In TOC, the delta values (initial decimal reduction time) of P. acidilactici were 63 and 7 min at 80 and 95 degrees C, respectively, and at all four temperatures they were not significantly different from delta values of E. faecium. The delta value of Salmonella at 80 degrees C (139 min) was two-fold greater than the other two bacteria's values (p < 0.05). In peanut butter, delta values of P. acidilactici ranged from 31 min at 63 degrees C to 2.6 min at 77 degrees C, and at all temperatures they were not significantly different from E. faecium's delta values. In peanut butter, all Salmonella cocktail's delta values were significantly smaller than P. acidilacticfs with values of 2 min at 63 degrees C and 0.4 min at 77 degrees C. These results indicated that P. acidilactici was as heat tolerant as E. faecium in these food matrices. However, the thermal inactivation kinetic parameters suggested that P. acidilactici can only be considered a Salmonella surrogate in TOC at temperatures above 85 degrees C. Because of its greater thermal tolerance in peanut butter, P. acidilactici may be used as Salmonella surrogate if an additional safety factor is recommended.",25,-1,1,99,1,0,2,1,1,1,328
"Background and objectives Compared to wheat bran, less information on physicochemical characteristics and health-related effects is available for bran from other cereals and results are often confounded by residual endosperm. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare structure and composition of endosperm-depleted bran of wheat, rye, oat, and maize, and link these characteristics to fecal fermentation characteristics. Findings Compared to wheat, endosperm-depleted rye bran contained twice the amount of fructan (8.0% dm) and water-extractable arabinoxylan (1.4% dm). Oat bran had a more open structure and was rich in (1,3:1,4)-beta-glucan (17.0% dm). For rye and oat bran, and to a lesser extent wheat bran, fermentation with fecal microbiota resulted in short chain fatty acid production, with full metabolization of fructan and beta-glucan after 2 and 24 hr of fecal fermentation, respectively. For maize bran, a less accessible structure containing over 70% of arabinoxylan and cellulose was coupled to a lower degree of fecal fermentation. Conclusion Removal of endosperm as a confounding factor when studying bran properties allowed us to obtain more accurate estimates of the composition, structure, and some physicochemical characteristics of bran of wheat, rye, oat, and maize. Bran fecal fermentation characteristics were mainly determined by composition and to a lesser extent by accessibility of the structure. Significance and novelty This is the first study that compares composition, structure, and fecal fermentation characteristics of wheat, rye, oat, and maize bran, after eliminating endosperm as a confounding factor. The knowledge obtained will allow a more goal-oriented choice of bran type for incorporation into food products, depending on targeted physiological effects and nutritional impact.",26,99,1,99,0,0,1,0,2,2,264
"Oat consumption is not a tradition in Brazil, and other cereals, such as rice, in combination with beans, are consumed almost daily in the Brazilian diet. Rapidly growing concerns about healthy diets are leading to increased oat consumption, and in the future, this trend could make oats an important staple in the Brazilian diet. The development of oat production in Brazil, initially an independent endeavor, has been supported by interactions between agriculture, academia, and industry. The results of these interactions have proven to be very successful, leading to the development of higher quality oats and oat products in Brazil.",27,1,1,0,99,1,3,0,1,1,99
"The purpose of our study was to evaluate the potential of solid-state yeast fermentation (SSYF) in improving the phenolic acid content and composition, and the antioxidant activity of commercial wheat bran (WB) and oat bran (OB). The ultrasound-assisted methanolic extracts were compared for their total phenolic content (TPC), phenolics composition, and in vitro antioxidant activity in order to study the effect of fermentation time on the chemical profile and activity of bioactive compounds. The comparative analysis revealed significant differences (p < 0.05) between days of fermentation (0 through 6). The highest TPCs were obtained on day 3 for WB (0.84 +/- 0.05 mg of gallic acid equivalents [GAE]/g dry weight [DW]), and on day 4 for OB (0.45 +/- 0.02 mg GAE/g DW). The highest relative percentage increase in the phenolics concentration of WB was also registered on day 3 (ferulic acid +56.6%, vanillic acid +259.3%, dihydroxybenzoic acids +161.2%, apigenin-glucoside +15.3%); for OB, this was observed on day 4 (avenanthramide 2f +48.5%, ferulic acid +21.2%). Enhanced antioxidant activities were significantly correlated with the highest TPCs. Our results suggest that SSYF may be a useful procedure for enrichment of antioxidants in cereal bran, considering the design of different functional foods and nutraceuticals.",28,1,0,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,201
"Oats are lipid-rich grains with high lipase activity. To extend the shelf life of noodles with a high oat flour content, oats were stabilized by steaming and subcritical butane defatting techniques. Subsequently, the physicochemical properties of oat flour and the processing, cooking and eating quality of noodles containing 70% oat flour were studied. Notably, steaming treatment completely inactivated lipase and peroxidase in oat flour, while subcritical butane defatting reduced the residual lipid content to < 1%. After stabilization, the degree of oat flour gelatinization was 32.74%, and the water absorption and water solution indexes had increased significantly (p < 0.05). Moreover, the pasting temperature decreased significantly and the paste viscosity increased significantly (p < 0.05). The resistance to extension and adhesiveness of the dough sheet increased by 12.2% and 93.4%, respectively. A 16.2% decrease in cooking loss and 25.9% increase in water absorption of noodles were observed. The cooked noodles exhibited significant increases in hardness, springiness and adhesiveness (p < 0.05). These findings indicated that stabilization treatment not only effectively inactivated enzymes, but also helps to improve the processing, cooking and eating quality of oat noodles.",29,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,186
"Heat treatment is used to physically modify starch to meet requirements for certain food products such as canned food, bread or noodles. In oats, the application of heat is used to inhibit activities of enzymes that cause undesirable effects on the end-product quality. However, it may also affect starch structure and functional properties of oats. This study examined the effects of heat treatment processing on starch molecular structure and physicochemical properties of oats using eight oat genotypes grown at four sites in Australia. Compared to non-heat-treated oats, heat treatment resulted in shorter amylopectin chains, higher amounts of long amylose chains and higher amylose content where amylose content and the relative amounts of long and short amylose chains are important determinants of functional properties of cereal-based food products. Heat treatment also increased gelatinization and pasting temperature but decreased gelatinization enthalpy, breakdown viscosity, final viscosity and setback viscosity. The peak viscosity remained unchanged. The results of this study show how heat-treated oats changes starch structure and properties, which could impact on processing for specific food products.",30,0,99,99,99,99,0,0,1,4,174
"Recently, cool-climate-adapted varieties of oats as well as milling-type and feed-type of oats have been developed. The objectives of this study were to determine biodegradation kinetics, enzymatic biodigestion, fractionation and intrinsic structure in seeds of oat varieties; compare among oat varieties and between milling-and feed-type; and reveal an interactive association among structure and nutrition in these seeds. The three oat varieties were CDC Nasser, which is a feed-type, CDC Arborg and CDC Ruffian, which are milling-types of oats. CDC Austenson barley, which is a feed-type of barley grain, was used as a control. The seed samples for each variety grown at University Crop Research Fields were obtained from Crop Development Center (CDC). The Attenuated total reflection - Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to reveal intrinsic structural profiles of these seeds. The results showed that different varieties had significant differences in chemical and nutrient profiles, biodegradation kinetics and intestinal digestibility (P < 0.05). Nasser oat, which was bred to possess a higher oil content and lower lignin hull, had a higher energy value compared to other varieties of oat. Nasser oat also showed similar values of digestible energy (DE), metabolizable energy (ME), net energy for maintenance (NEm), net energy for gain (NEg) and net energy for lactation (NEL) to Austenson barley grain. Austenson barley seeds showed higher (P < 0.05) rumen undegraded protein (BCP) and had an increased biodegradation ratio of available N to energy (ED_N/ED_OM) during longer incubation periods. Uni- and multivariate (PCA) analyses were applied to reveal structural features. The PCA analysis did not distinguish between Nasser (feed-type) and Ruffian (milling-type) in the amide region. Significant relationship was revealed between protein molecular structures and protein biodegradation kinetics. In conclusion, Nasser oat (feed-type oat grain) is a promising variety with high fat and low hull content which",31,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,299
"Background and objectives Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins in cereal grains. In temperate climates, Penicillium verrucosum is the primary OTA producer. Our objectives were (a) to determine the effects of various factors on OTA accumulation in oat grain inoculated with P. verrucosum and (b) to develop a method to screen oat cultivars for OTA accumulation. Findings Grain samples from three oat cultivars were inoculated with three different isolates of P. verrucosum, incubated at two water activity levels (0.85 and 0.90 a(w)) and two temperatures (22.5 and 27.5 degrees C) for 4, 7, and 10 weeks. A water activity of 0.90 and a temperature of 22.5 degrees C provided the highest level of OTA accumulation. Isolate C1136-1 was the highest OTA producer among the isolates of P. verrucosum studied. The longer the incubation period, the higher the OTA accumulation in oat grain samples was. Conclusions The P. verrucosum isolate, the water activity and temperature during incubation, and the incubation period, all had an effect on the level of OTA accumulation. Inoculating grains with isolate C84-2 and incubating at 22.5 degrees C and 0.90 a(w) for 7 weeks provided adequate conditions to screen oat cultivars for OTA accumulation. Significance and novelty A new protocol was developed that can be used for discriminating among oat cultivars for level of OTA accumulation. It would ultimately help breeders and pathologists in selecting genotypes with reduced OTA accumulation.",32,99,1,1,1,99,3,0,0,2,237
"Background and objectives Phenolic compounds present in oats provide an opportunity for oats to increase its use in the form of functional food. In this study, eight varieties of Australian-grown whole-grain oat were investigated for their phenolic composition and antioxidant potential. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-online 2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), coupled with liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight, was used to identify and quantify individual phenolic compounds and their respective antioxidant activity. Findings Considerable variation in phenolic content (19.51 +/- 1.20-52.49 +/- 1.70 mg 100 g(-1) GAE) and antioxidant activity was observed among the oat varieties. Several avenanthramides (AVNs) were detected with AVN A and AVN C being the most abundant. AVN C exhibited the highest antioxidant activity followed by caffeic acid, quercetin-3,4 '-O-di-beta-glucopyranoside derivative, and 6-hydroxykaempferol 3,5,7,4 '-tetramethyl ether 6-rhamnoside. Antioxidant activity in AVNs was observed to be the highest in AVN C followed by AVN B and AVN A. Conclusions High levels of AVN C and the range of phenolic compounds present show promise of Australian-grown oats as an important source of antioxidant compounds. These antioxidant compounds may contribute to consumers' health benefits. Significance and novelty This study contributes to the use of oats as potential functional food by characterizing its individual phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity.",33,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,205
"Background: Since its introduction to the analytical community, the R5 method to quantify gluten led to a strong improvement of the situation for the food industry and celiac patients. During recent years, some questions arose on the use of the Codex Alimentarius factor of two to convert from prolamins to gluten, an overestimation of rye and barley, inadequate detection of glutelins, and the inhomogeneous distribution of gluten in oats. These limitations of the R5 method, especially when measuring oat samples, led to AOAC Standard Method Performance Requirement (SMPR (R)) 2017.021, which was approved by stakeholders in 2017. Objective: We present a collaborative study of a method for the quantitative analysis of wheat, rye, and barley gluten in oat and oat products using a sandwich ELISA that is based on four different monoclonal antibodies including the R5 monoclonal anitbody. Methods: The sandwich ELISA detects intact gliadins and related prolamins from rye and barley, high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits (GS) from wheat, HMW secalins from rye, and low-molecular-weight (LMW) GS from wheat. It does not detect D-hordeins from barley. Samples are extracted by Cocktail solution, subsequently followed by 80% ethanol, and analyzed within 50 min. Results: The measurement range is between 5 and 80 mg/kg gluten using a calibrator made out of a gluten extract from four different wheat cultivars. The results of the collaborative test with 19 participating laboratories showed recoveries ranging from 99 to 137% for all three grain sources. Relative reproducibility SDs for samples >10 mg/kg gluten ranged from 10 to 53%. Conclusions: The collaborative study results confirmed that the method is accurate and suitable to measure gluten from all three grain sources and has demonstrated performance on oat matrices, which meets the criteria as specified in SMPR 2017.021. Data from in-house validation experiments are available as Annex B to this publication.",34,0,99,99,99,99,0,0,1,4,302
"Volatile profiles of oat-based foods are mainly analyzed on the oat flakes and porridge as snack or breakfast, whereas the volatile characteristics of the traditional Chinese oat meal (TCOM), a popular main food in some regions of northern China, with special strong aroma, are not known. Here, we compared the volatile profiles from headspace solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of oat porridge (OP) and TCOM, which were of different processing and cooking methods, from those of different cultivars, and analyzed the effect of cultivation locations on oat volatile features. Apart from the 35 volatiles shared by OP and TCOM, there were 23 and 24 volatiles specific to OP and TCOM, respectively, with the later showing more toasting and frying-related volatiles due to the dry frying process of the grains before milling. Principle component analysis of the volatiles of OP and TCOM from 16 cultivars showed that they were clustered into two groups, and four cultivars were clustered together, independent of processing and cooking methods. The oat volatile profiles of cultivars grown in three regions of north China were dependent on the cultivation locations rather than cultivars, regardless of OP or TCOM, with those from Datong of Shanxi Province and Zhangjiakou of Hebei Province clustered together. The location effect could be due to significant less precipitation in the two regions above than the other region Ulanqab of Inner Mongolia. Practical Application The volatile compounds in oat are closely related to cultivation regions, which could be applied as a key factor by oat producers for marketing. The four cultivars showed similar and stable volatile profiles, which could be used as reference cultivars for breeding of high-quality oat with better flavor.",35,99,0,1,99,1,2,0,1,2,280
"Today, market searches for new alternatives to traditional food products that could be more nutritious for consumers. Modified atmosphere packaging could be used as the preservation method for the products with increased nutritional value. Therefore, the research was conducted wherein bread with added oat dietary fibre (16% beta-glucan), and two soy flours [1.2% (full fat soy flour (FFS)) and 14.5% fat (defatted soy flour (DFS))] were used. The bread were stored for 3 and 7 days in normal atmosphere and with 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% carbon dioxide. The methodology consisted of specific volume, firmness, colour, beta-glucan and dietary fibre determination and fatty acid profile. The fatty acid profile was most promising in terms of health in the sample with added DFS (polyunsaturated fatty acids% > 49.6). The optimisation procedure estimated that the carbon dioxide should be 15.5% for control, 38.5% for FFS, and 4.8% for DFS bread.",36,1,1,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,149
"Objectives: It is unclear whether addition of soluble fiber to a low-calorie diet potentializes weight loss and amelioration of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of oat bran on prevalence of MetS and associated disorders. Methods: A pragmatic, randomized controlled, 6-wk nutritional trial was carried out with 154 outpatients (mean age 47.6 +/- 12.6 y of age). The intervention group (n = 83) received a low-calorie diet plus 40 g/d of oat bran; the control group (n = 71) received a low-calorie diet only. MetS parameters and prevalence were calculated and compared (using two-tailed statistical tests) before and after follow-up. Results: After follow-up, a significant but similar reduction was observed in MetS prevalence (40% reduction, 63% and 64.8% prevalence in intervention and control groups, respectively; P= 0.226), body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triacylglycerides, and blood glucose levels in both groups (P < 0.05). Mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was reduced in the intervention group (43.6 +/- 9.6 to 41.2 +/- 9.5 mg/dL; P= 0.025), but not in the control group (44.6 +/- 10.5 to 44.5 +/- 12.1 mg/dL; P= 0.890). There was no significant difference in any of the variables between the groups, although the P-value for HDL-C was almost significant (P= 0.078). Calorie and dietetic fiber intake during the 6-wk period were similar in both groups. Conclusions: Daily consumption of oat bran did not potentialize the beneficial effects of a traditional low-calorie diet on the prevalence of MetS and associated disorders. Additionally, it reduced HDL-C. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",37,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,3,0,267
"The objective of this study was to explore the production of an expanded snack entirely based on pea- and oat-rich fractions using the extrusion technology. The effect of the die temperature, HZ6 (146-175 degrees C) and blend moisture content, MC (11.2 and 16.8% dry basis) were investigated aiming at maximizing expansion, while obtaining a good texture and pleasant sensory perception. The best response was obtained with a HZ6 of 160 degrees C and MC of 11.2%. MC was the parameter that most influenced final extrudate properties/responses. The gross composition of the raw-material was not modified by extrusion processing apart from a decrease in glucose and fructose content attributed to Maillard reactions. The snacks contained 3.5 g of beta-glucan per portion.

"Background and objectives The aim of this research was to gain a deeper insight into the effect caused by the addition of sprouted oat to food products. The effect of temperature and duration of the sprouting process was systematically studied by sprouting oat grains between 10 and 30 degrees C for up to 3 days. Findings Overall, it was found that temperatures between 20 and 25 degrees C yield the most dramatic changes in the properties of sprouted oats. Based on the data, a simple system to characterize the sprouting progress by a visual inspection of the lengths of the coleoptile and radicles was developed. This degree of sprouting (DoS) was correlated with further grain properties. Conclusions It was found that an exponential relationship between the DoS and grain properties existed. Furthermore, the observed increase in the reducing sugar content (up to 14.6 g/100 g) with increasing DoS was closely related to the increase in alpha-amylase activity (up to 25 U/g). Significance and novelty The good predictive power found indicates that the application of the concept degree of sprouting could develop into a reliable characterization method for sprouted grains usable for product development and specification.",39,99,1,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,195
"The purpose of this research was to study the effect of micronised oat bran on dietary fibre, textural and rheological of soft cheese. The soft cheese was processed by using the different particle size oat bran as fibre supplement, and its dietary fibre content, rheological and textural properties were determined. The results show that the micronised oat bran with 5-30 mu m particle size was prepared by ultrafine grinding and passed through 60-400 mesh sieves. The soluble dietary fibre content in micronised oat bran soft cheeses was higher than that of the control (untreated oat bran soft cheeses; P < 0.05), with a maximum of 2.65 g per 100 g cheeses when oat bran was ultrafine crushed and passed through 300 mesh sieves, while the content of insoluble dietary fibre was lower than that of the control (P < 0.05). The micronised oat bran soft cheese in fermentation is a typical non-newtonian fluid. G ', G '' and apparent viscosity of soft cheeses were increased with the reduction of oat bran particle size. The chewiness and springiness of micronised soft cheeses were increased with the reduction of oat bran particle size, and were higher than that of the control (P < 0.05). The hardness and cohesiveness of micronised soft cheese were decreased with the reduction of oat bran particle size, the hardness was lower, but the cohesiveness of micronised soft cheese was higher than that of the control (P < 0.05).

"The oca (Oxalis tuberosa) is a tuber with high starch content and excellent antioxidant properties, which can be used in the production of extruded products; however, starch-rich products can be improved nutritionally through the incorporation of fibers that can result in extrudates with beneficial health properties. The aim of this work was to develop a mixture of oca (Oxalis tuberosa) and oat extrudate flours and evaluate the antioxidant and physicochemical attributes. The results showed that a higher moisture content increased the hardness, water absorption index, and density of the extrudates; however, the solubility and expansion indexes showed an inverse pattern. The addition of oat fiber had the opposite effect from moisture content on the physicochemical properties mentioned above. The cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) of the extrudates decreased when the oat fiber increased. An inverse pattern was observed when the moisture concentration was increased. The starch hydrolysis percentage and glycemic index decreased significantly when the fiber content increased. Oat fiber contributed 67.29% and 65.04% to these parameters, respectively. Oat fiber exerted a greater effect than moisture on the collets extruded in this study according to factor contributions.",41,0,1,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,186
"The influence of different packaging films and their thickness (polyethylene terephthalate/casting polypropylene (PET/CPP_34), biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP_40), polyvinylchloride (PVC_12), BOPP/CPP_50 and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol/polypropylene (PE/EVOH/PP_50) on the quality of gluten-free oat biscuits was evaluated for a storage period up to 3months under light and darkness conditions. Periodically (day 30, 60 and 90), physical parameters, peroxide value, texture and microbiological parameters together with sensory attributes (surface colour, smell, taste, crunchiness and off-flavour) were assessed. Moisture and water activity of biscuits decreased during storage in all packages. The highest peroxide value was obtained for biscuits packed in PVC_12, while the lowest was for the PE/EVOH/PP_50, for both storage conditions. The biscuits' colour changed from yellow-brown to light yellow and the change was more pronounced in the light as compared to the dark storage conditions. The hardness value decreased (p>0.05) during the storage period. The electronic nose system showed that the distinct volatile composition of the biscuits stored in the light was correlated with the higher scores of the off-flavour attribute and with the peroxide values. The sensory data showed that BOPP/CPP_50 preserved the colour of the biscuits, while PE/EVOH/PP_50 kept the initial crunchiness of the biscuits up to 90days of storage in both light and dark conditions. The study suggested that BOPP/CPP_50 and PE/EVOH/PP_50 can be used for gluten-free oat biscuits' packaging and storage up to 90days for both conditions studied, without adversely affecting their physicochemical and sensory properties.",42,0,99,1,99,1,2,0,1,2,237
"Malnutrition is the reason for stunted growth among children and nutritional deficiencies are prevalent in all age groups. The present food industry provides food products that are not necessarily nutrient rich. Quinoa, Chickpeas and Oats are better supplier of nutrients and are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals therefore these are used to develop the food product. The present study was designed to focus on the development of the best sample of the tarts that was acceptable by all age groups. A panel of twenty experts examined four samples of tarts, namely A, B, C & D, which were made with different variations in the ratio of Quinoa: Chickpea: Oats as 30: 35: 3540: 30: 30, 50: 25: 25 and 60: 20: 20 respectively. The scores obtained from the panel of experts were used to evaluate the best tart in terms of six evaluation criteria i.e. appearance, color, texture, taste, flavor and aftertaste. TOPSIS methodology was used for ranking of tarts as this is the best MADM methodology for ranking of the criteria. This research assessed the effects of baking on the development of tarts and it was found that a successful food product could be made using the ratio of 60: 20: 20 (sample D).

"This study reports the effect of the addition of oat bran and apple flour on the cooking quality, digestibility, antioxidant, nutritional and texture characteristics of a spaghetti-type pasta. Pasta samples were prepared by substituting 50% of durum wheat semolina with oat bran (OBP) or apple flour (AFP). AFP presented higher cooking loss and water absorption index than the control pasta prepared with 100% durum wheat semolina (WSP). The supplementation of pasta with oat bran increased the total dietary fiber content (16.43% w/w, dw), while apple flour decreased the protein content (11.16% w/w, dw). There was no significant difference in the resistant starch content among all pasta samples. The pasta samples made with 50/50 durum wheat semolina/oat bran and 50/50 durum wheat semolina/apple flour increased the antioxidant activity by approximate to 46% and approximate to 97%, respectively. The OBP and AFP samples had a similar texture to the control pasta. A 50% replacement of durum wheat semolina with oat bran in a pasta formulation decreased the caloric content and digestibility of its starch components.

"Forty three oat genotypes including six cultivars and thirty seven advance breeding lines were evaluated for composition of carbohydrates, total soluble proteins, minerals, antinutritional factors such as phytic acid, saponin and tannin and fiber (beta-glucan, cellulose and lignin) content. The average contents of total soluble sugars, starch and total protein were 5.3, 494.3 and 182.9 mg/g respectively. The average content of zinc (8.3 mg/100 g) was higher than iron (3.5 mg/100 g) in oats. The oat genotypes were then sorted out into high, medium and low categories following the equal distribution method. Ten genotypes (OL-10, OL-125, OL-1769, OL-1835, OL-1841, OL-1843, OL-1847, OL-1865, OL-1873, OL-1876) possessed low antinutritional factors in terms of phytic acid, saponin and tannin contents. Among them, OL-1843 and OL-1865 were considered nutritionally best as they lied in higher/medium range of starch, zinc, total soluble protein, beta-glucan and iron. They were followed by OL-1873, which possessed high contents of total soluble sugars, starch and zinc together with the medium amounts of total fructose and iron.

"Oat beta-glucan has been known as a healthy food ingredient due to its cholesterol and glucose lowing effects. The physical properties which consequently induce its bioactivities are generally impacted by its quantity and quality. In this research, the relationship between content and molecular weight of beta-glucan and solvent retention capacity (SRC) values of oat flours from 30 varieties were investigated. The beta-glucan content was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with all SRC parameters except sucrose SRC, and the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.615) was found in calcium chloride SRC. Molecular weight was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with SRC of water and calcium chloride, and the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.735) was found in water SRC. Oat protein and starch content had no significant relationship with all SRC, indicating that the suitability of SRC for oat was different from wheat. Oat beta-glucan content and molecular weight prediction equation was established by multiple stepwise regression analysis. The results indicated that SRC could be used as a quick predictor for oat beta-glucan content and molecular weight.",47,0,99,1,0,0,1,0,3,1,176
"The core-shell structured micelles from octenylsuccinated oat beta-glucan (OS beta G) are able to solubilize beta-carotene (beta C). This study reveals molecular interactions governing the formation, stabilization, and beta C uptake of OS beta G micelles (OS beta G-Ms) by means such as water contact angle, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamic light scattering, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results indicated that the micellization of OS beta G molecules is triggered by hydrophobic interactions between octenylsuccinate (OSA) moieties, while OS beta G-Ms are stabilized via both hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. For their uptake of beta C, beta C molecules are first adsorbed onto OS beta G-Ms by interacting with OSA moieties scattered on micelle surface. By further interacting with OSA moieties located in micelle shell, beta C molecules travel across the shell and finally are trapped in the hydrophobic core. In simulated gastrointestinal fluids, beta C is controlled released from OS beta G-Ms as an integrated consequence of its diffusion as well as the swelling and erosion of OS beta G-Ms. As a result, this study first uncovered the mechanism underlying the uptake of beta C by OS beta G-Ms, which will certainly facilitate the effective loading of hydrophobic ingredients by OS beta G-Ms.",48,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,3,0,205
"The hydration characterization of food materials is necessary for effective and efficient evaluation, design, and optimization of processes, thus ensuring high quality products. This work evaluated the hydration kinetics and modeled the behavior of oat (Avena sativa) grains as a function of temperature (25-55 degrees C). The behavior of the grains during hydration showed a downward concave shape, with a high initial water absorption rate. Although Peleg's model could describe the data adequately, it showed some inability in specific parts of the hydration process. Therefore, the Miano-Ibarz-Augusto's model was also evaluated, with better description. Possible mechanisms were discussed. The parameters of both models were evaluated as functions of temperature. The obtained generalized models were then validated at both isothermal and nonisothermal conditions. The obtained results are potentially useful for future studies on product development, food properties, and process design.",49,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,3,0,139
"Six variables (temperature, pressure, static time, dynamic time, chemical pretreatment, and particle size) were evaluated in the supercritical CO2 extraction of oil from oats (Avena sativa L.), by the responses obtained using a Plackett-Burman statistical design, including the mass of oil extracted, main fatty acids (GC-MS), polyphenols (HPLC), antioxidant activity (ORAC), and total phenolic content (TPC). For the mass of oil extracted, pressure (55 MPa) and particle size ( > 250 mu m) were significant, with a highest yield of 0.800 g/20 g oat. Oleic acid was the most abundant fatty acid (45-53%), followed by linoleic (36-42%) and palmitic (12-16%). Fatty acid composition was significantly affected by particle size, pretreatment, and temperature. The polyphenols vanillin (43.33 mu g/g oil), ferulic acid (53.6 mu g/g oil), vanillic acid (0.78 mu g/g oil), and coumaric acid (2.2 mu g/g oil) were detected. Pretreatment and high temperature were significant for increasing the polyphenol content of the oil fractions. TPC was also increased by temperature and pretreatment (97.1 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g oil) and showed a good correlation with polyphenols (R-2 = 82%). Additionally, ORAC antioxidant activity (265 mmol Trolox equivalents/g oil) was significantly affected by pretreatment, temperature (80 degrees C), and particle size ( > 250 mu m).",50,0,1,1,99,1,3,0,1,1,206
"Oat noodles are becoming popular for its health and flavor. The study investigated the glucose metabolic effects of oat noodles with different processing in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Oat noodles were prepared by traditional method (TON), extrusion (EON) and extrusion-freezing (FON), respectively, and the glucose metabolic effects were also investigated with C57BL/6 male mice. It was found that all three oat noodles types significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose and glycosylated serum protein level (p < 0.05), as well as improved glucose tolerance ability (p < 0.05). All types of oat noodles effectively (p < 0.05) increased fasting insulin and glycogen metabolism level (p < 0.05), inhibited intestinal enzyme activity as well as improved the serum lipids and liver function regulation (p < 0.05). TON and FON showed excellent ability on reducing fasting blood glucose and glycosylated serum protein than EON, while FON with significantly lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and aspartate aminotransferase might be better than TON. Our results suggested that all types of oat noodles, especially TON and FON had hypoglycemic and hypocholesterolemic effects on diabetic mice and was potential to be an alternative dietary intervention for diabetic adjustment.",51,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,189
"Material disintegration is the primary step in beta-glucan determination in cereal grains. This study investigated the effect of disintegration approach on beta-glucan content, determined by an enzymatic method in mature kernels of barley and oat. Milling with a coffee grinder was found to be relevant only for pre-disintegration and homogenization of the grain (4.6% and 3.2% beta-glucan content was found in barley and oats, respectively). Ball milling appeared to be the most efficient approach for reducing material particle size, but resulted in samples with underestimated beta-glucan content (4.6% and 3.3% in barley and oats, respectively). Grinding with mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and repeated centrifugal milling were found to be the optimal disintegration methods for barley kernels (5.2% and 4.7-4.8% beta-glucan content, respectively). Grinding with mortar and pestle (either in dry state or in liquid nitrogen) and single centrifugal milling were the optimal disintegration methods for oat kernels (3.6-3.9% and 3.3-3.4% beta-glucan content, respectively).",52,1,99,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,155
"Kilning is an important step in the processing of oat flakes. The main aims of kilning are to stabilize the final product using heat to eliminate enzymatic activity that causes rancidity and steam to temper the product, which prepares the groat for flaking. Additional effects of heat treatment may include development of flavor and some degree of microbial contaminant reduction. The Revtech continuous kilning system ensures accurate control of residence time, complete homogeneity of treatment, high heat and mass transfer, and a wide range of precisely controlled operating parameters. The absence of dead zones and plug-flow behavior inside the stainless-steel tube ensure that all particles moving through the system receive the same treatment, vastly improving the overall quality of the final product.",53,99,1,99,99,1,2,0,0,3,122
"The food industry has a considerable demand for functional foods, such as emulsions as delivery system for omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. Such delivery systems must be stabilized, ideally with a compound that fulfills the criteria for both functionality and sustainability. Spruce galactoglucomannans (GGM) are novel, wood-derived, natural, value-added, versatile, multi-purpose emulsifiers that can physically stabilize oil-in-water emulsions while simultaneously protecting the oil phase against oxidation. In this study, we present for the first time the use of GGM-stabilized emulsions as complex multicomponent delivery systems for omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, i.e., (1) cod liver oil in drinkable yogurt and (2) oat oil in a gluten-free vegan beverage. The emulsions and the resulting functionalized beverages were characterized in terms of their physical stabilities. In addition, functionalized, drinkable yogurt was characterized in terms of the oxidative stability of the oil. Results highlighted that oil droplets stabilized with GGM were stable during storage, against thermal treatment, upon addition into the beverages, and GGM protected cod liver oil against oxidation in drinkable yogurt. The results reported here highlight the vast potential for the use of wood lignocellulose-derived, multi-functional hydrocolloids in modern foods.",54,0,1,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,189
"Power ultrasound as an emerging processing technology has been investigated for stimulating seeds to enhance germination and accumulation of health-promoting metabolites, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and phenolic compounds. This work was undertaken to evaluate the effects of power ultrasound (25 kHz) on the nutritional properties of germinated oats, and the microstructure of oat groats after treatment. The changes in the external and internal microstructures of the ultrasound-treated oats kernel were investigated using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and 3D X-ray Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT). Physicochemical properties of oats including GABA, free sugars, avenanthramides, total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacities were enhanced after germination. Furthermore, the power ultrasound treatment for 5 min after soaking significantly enhanced the GABA (48-96 h), alanine (24-96 h), succinic acid (48-72 h), total phenolic content (24 h), and total avenanthramides (24 h) in the germinated oats.",55,99,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,5,141
"Oats can be processed in a variety of ways ranging from minimally processed such as steel-cut oats (SCO), to mildly processed such as large-flake oats (old fashioned oats, OFO), moderately processed such as instant oats (IO) or highly processed in ready-to-eat oat cereals such as Honey Nut Cheerios (HNC). Although processing is believed to increase glycaemic and insulinaemic responses, the effect of oat processing in these respects is unclear. Thus, we compared the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses elicited by 628 kJ portions of SCO, OFO, IO and HNC and a portion of Cream of Rice cereal (CR) containing the same amount of available-carbohydrate (23 g) as the oatmeals. Healthy males (n 18) and females (n 12) completed this randomised, cross-over trial. Blood was taken fasting and at intervals for 3 h following test-meal consumption. Glucose and insulin peak-rises and incremental AUC (iAUC) were subjected to repeated-measures ANOVA using Tukey's test (two-sided P<0 center dot 05) to compare individual means. Glucose peak-rise (primary endpoint, mean (sem) mmol/l) after OFO, 2 center dot 19 (sem 0 center dot 11), was significantly less than after CR, 2 center dot 61 (sem 0 center dot 13); and glucose peak-rise after SCO, 1 center dot 93 (sem 0 center dot 13), was significantly less than after CR, HNC, 2 center dot 49 (sem 0 center dot 13) and IO 2 center dot 47 (sem 0 center dot 13). Glucose iAUC was significantly lower after SCO than CR and HNC. Insulin peak rise was similar among the test meals, but insulin iAUC was significantly less after SCO than IO. Thus, the results show that oat processing affects glycaemic and insulinaemic responses with lower responses associated with less processing.",56,1,0,99,1,1,3,0,1,1,282
"Background and Objectives: Oats contain antioxidant phytochemicals that may help reduce inflammation as well as oxidative stress. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of oat porridge consumption on inflammatory marker levels and oxidative stress in Thai adults with high blood lipid levels. Methods and Study Design: A randomized crossover study was conducted. Hypercholesterolemic adults were randomly assigned to a 4-week daily consumption of oat or rice porridge. After 4 weeks, they were switched to alternate intervention arms for 4 weeks. At baseline, before and after each intervention period, inflammatory markers including hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1 and antioxidant status markers including ORAC, FRAP, and MDA of all subjects were measured. Results: Compared to baseline, levels of hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha were significantly decreased after oat porridge consumption (mean change: -0.6 +/- 0.9 mg/L, -26.9 +/- 27.6 pg/mL, -56.3 +/- 27.6 pg/mL, and -9.7 +/- 11.6 pg/mL, p<0.05 for all, respectively). In addition, consumption of oat porridge also increased antioxidant capacity; ORAC and FRAP levels (mean change: 2.7 +/- 1.0 mu mol of Trolox/L and 2.4 +/- 0.8 mu mol of Fe2+/L, p<0.001, respectively). However, MCP-1 and MDA levels were not affected. Consumption of rice porridge did not lead to significant changes in these measures. Conclusions: Daily consumption of 70 grams oat porridge containing 3 grams beta-glucan for 4 weeks may help reduce markers of inflammation and oxidation in hypercholesterolemic adults. Therefore, oat may be an appropriate dietary recommendation for individuals with hypercholesterolemia.",57,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,247
"Background and objective: Consumers show increasing interests in probiotic foods and lactic acid fermentations. Cereal flour, can be a good fermentable substrate due to its prebiotic nature; from which, synbiotic products can be prepared. The aim of the current study was to investigate if three various cereal flours rice, oat and wheat would be good potentially functional foods. Material and methods: Fermentation tests were carried out on rice, oat and wheat flours, using Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 and 1.5-L fermenter with 1-L working volume. After 24 h, microbial growth, pH value, lactic acid production and starch consumption were assessed. Results and conclusion: In all three flours, pH reduction was seen; particularly in rice flour. The highest Lactobacillus growth and lactic acid production were achieved at the end of rice fermentation. The greatest starch consumption was reported at the end of rice fermentation. In conclusion, lactic fermentation of cereals as potentially functional foods was possible for the three flours. However, the best result belonged to rice flour.",58,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,166
"The aim of this study was to optimize the addition of oat fiber and inulin as fat substitutes in cooked Paio sausage using response surface methodology. The chemical composition, textural parameters, color properties, lipid oxidation, microbial analysis and sensory properties were assessed in twelve different treatments. The addition of dietary fiber led to a significant (P < 0.05) increase in moisture content and also a decrease in fat content of between 60.78% and 63.16%. Color parameters were significantly affected by the addition of inulin and oat fiber, as lightness decreases with the addition of oat fiber. Similar happened with redness, the lowest results were for the treatment with higher dietary fiber content added. Regarding lipid oxidation, the inclusion of fiber did not influence the TBARS values among treatments and throughout the storage time. Sausages manufactured with inulin and oat fiber present similar scores for color, taste and overall acceptability, while lower texture values were found in sausages manufactured with oat fiber. The addition of up to 6% of inulin with up to 0.85% oat fiber in a low fat cooked Paio sausage did not compromise technological parameters and sensory acceptably.",59,1,1,0,99,0,2,0,2,1,190
"Normal pressure steaming, high pressure steaming, microwave, and frying are widely used to deactivate enzyme in the oats, but these thermal processing methods may affect the structural and functional properties of soluble dietary fiber, which contribute greatly to the health benefits of oat foods. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of four different thermal processing methods on the structural and functional properties of soluble dietary fiber from whole grain oats. The results showed that the thermal processing resulted in changes on nutritional components of whole grain oats. Especially dietary fiber components, the total dietary fiber, insoluble dietary fiber, and soluble dietary fiber content of heat-treated oats were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Moreover, thermal processing can not only result in an increase in molecular weight and particle size, but also cause molecular aggregation and different functional properties of soluble dietary fiber. High pressure steaming-treated oat soluble dietary fiber displayed significantly higher swelling and emulsifying (p < 0.05), but microwave-treated oat soluble dietary fiber exhibited the highest glucose, cholesterol, and sodium cholate adsorption capacities. These results might provide basic information to help to better understand the functionality of oat soluble dietary fiber and improve the process efficiency of oat foods with high nutritional qualities.",60,1,0,0,0,-1,1,1,3,0,207
"Dietary fibre fortified products have increased in popularity as health-conscious consumers seek convenient ways to increase fibre intake. Fibres from wholegrains are particularly desirable inclusions in food products because of their proven physiological health-benefits. When fortifying beverages with fibre, however, the insoluble dietary fibre components present in wholegrains often contribute to unpleasant gritty sensations making the products unpalatable. Consequently, designing wholegrain-fortified beverages with sufficient fibre-content to make health related fibre claims is a major challenge in the food manufacturing industry. This work aims to take a systematic approach in identifying the texture/mouthfeel related sensory impact and interaction between two commercial oat fibre ingredients (Oatwell28XF (R) and Milled Oats) when added to a model beverage system. Eighteen samples were prepared containing either or both the ingredients, at varying levels, and were assessed by a trained panel using conventional sensory descriptive techniques. The results indicate that the two different oat bran fibres produced distinct mouthfeel perceptions which could be attributed to the varying soluble and insoluble fibre content of the samples. Insoluble dietary fibre concentrations above 2% (w/w) resulted in particle-related sensory properties chalkiness, dryness and particle perception, which dominated the overall mouthfeel and textural sensory perception of the samples. Samples with predominantly soluble beta-glucan, resulted in perceptions of smoothness, sliminess and stickiness residue, while thickness, mouthcoating and cloying sensations were driven by total fibre concentration, irrespective of fibre solubility. This work provides a solid foundation for food manufacturers aiming to rationally design and develop nutritionally superior fibre-fortified beverages and is relevant to fibre content concentrations required for labelling/nutrition claims for consumer products in many developed nations.",61,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,265
"The objective of this work was to find out how the method to extract proteins and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis affect the ability of hepatic cells to resist oxidative stress. Proteins were isolated from oat brans in the presence of Cellulase (CPI) or Viscozyme (VPI). Four protein hydrolysates were produced from CPI and four others from VPI when they treated with Alcalase, Flavourzyme, Papain, or Protamex. Apart from CPI-Papain that reduced the viability of cell by 20%, no other hydrolysate was cytotoxic in the hepatic HepG2 cells. In the cytoprotection test, VPI-Papain and VPI-Flavourzyme fully prevented the damage due to peroxyl radical while CPI-Papain and CPI-Alcalase enhanced the cellular damage. Cells treated with VPI-hydrolysates reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 20-40% and, also increased the intracellular concentration of glutathione, compared to CPI-hydrolysates. In antioxidant enzyme assays, although all hydrolysates enhanced the activity of both superoxide dismutase and catalase by up to 2- and 3.4-fold, respectively relative the control cells, the largest increase was due to VPI-Papain and VPI-Flavourzyme hydrolysates. In caspase-3 assays, hydrolysates with reduced ROS or enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities were able to reduce the activity of the pro-apoptotic enzyme, caspase-3 indicating that they prevented oxidative stress-induced cell death.",62,1,1,99,1,1,4,0,0,1,200
"The aim of the present study was to determine how variation in the biscuit matrix affects both the degree of in vitro fragmentation and the starch hydrolysis that occurs during the oral phase of digestion. Using three different oat ingredient types (oat flour, small flakes, and big flakes) and baking powder (or none), six biscuits with different matrices were obtained. The instrumental texture (force and sound measurements) of the biscuits was analyzed. The samples were then subjected to in vitro fragmentation. The particle size distribution and in vitro oral starch hydrolysis over time of the fragmented samples were evaluated. The results showed that the samples presented different fragmentation patterns, mainly depending on the oat ingredient type, which could be related to their differences in texture. The biscuits made with oat flour were harder, had a more compact matrix and showed more irregular fragmentation and a higher percentage area of small particles than those made with big oat flakes, which were more fragile and crumbly. The highest degree of starch hydrolysis corresponded to the biscuits made with flour. Conclusions: Differences in the mechanical properties of the biscuit matrix, in this case due to differences in the oat ingredient, play a role in the in vitro fragmentation pattern of biscuits and in the oral phase of starch hydrolysis.",63,-1,0,99,99,99,0,1,1,3,216
"Oatmeal is a whole grain (WG) food rich in fiber and other nutrients. The study objective was to compare diet quality and nutrient intake of children consuming oatmeal breakfasts to those of children consuming other breakfasts using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014. Dietary intake data from 5876 children aged 2-18 years were divided by breakfast food consumption: oatmeal breakfasts, Doughnuts, sweet rolls, pastries, Pancakes, waffles, French toast, Eggs and omelets, Ready-to-eat cereal, lower sugar, and Ready-to-eat cereal, higher sugar were used to assess diet quality and intake of food groups and nutrients using the USDA Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), Food Patterns Equivalents Database, and Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, respectively. As compared to consumers of other breakfasts or breakfast skippers, oatmeal consumers had consistently higher diet quality (4-16 points higher HEI 2015 total score, p < 0.05), higher WG intake (0.6-1.6 oz eq. higher, p < 0.05), and higher fiber and magnesium intakes compared to consumers of most other breakfasts or breakfast skippers. The results show that children consuming oatmeal breakfasts have better diet quality and increased intake of key nutrients compared to breakfast skippers and other breakfast consumers and suggest oatmeal may represent an important component of a healthy childhood diet.",64,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,208
"Cardiovascular diseases caused by atherosclerosis have become one of the leading cause of death. The aim of the present study was to explore how oat fiber regulated lipid metabolism and to elucidate its anti-atherosclerotic potential in ApoE(-/-) mice. Animals were daily fed a high-fat diet without or with 0.8% oat fiber for 18 weeks. Both serum total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol levels decreased in mice received oat fiber administration than those without Oat fiber inhibited hepatic lipid accumulation by downregulating SREBP-1 expression and accelerated clearance of intestinal cholesterol by upregulating SREBP-2 expression. In addition, oat fiber activated cholesterol sensors LXR alpha, and then strengthened hepatic and intestinal cholesterol efflux by increasing ATP-binding cassette A1 and G1, and decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption by inhibiting Niemann pick C 1 like 1. The findings implicated that oat fiber had an anti-atherosclerotic potential via mechanisms of activating the SREBPs/LXR alpha pathway and improving lipid metabolism.",65,1,1,-1,1,1,4,1,0,0,151
"This study evaluated the effects of malting and in vitro digestion on the bioaccessibility of six avenanthramides (AVNs), soluble phenols (SPs) and antioxidant capacity (ORAC) in cookies (3B, 4B, 5B) prepared with oat flour malted for three (M3), four (M4), five (M5) days, respectively. Control cookies (CTRL) were made with non-malted oat flour (M0). Five-days malting increased the AVN content of native kernels up to 10-folds, whereas SPs and ORAC tripled their values. After the in vitro digestion, AVNs showed their bioaccessibility in the following order: 5B > 4B > 3B, with a recovery of 1703 mu g AVNs per 50 g portion of 5B cookies, compared to 135 mu g of CTRL. Results showed that the inclusion of 27% malted oat flour was effective to formulate functional cookies with satisfactory technological properties, high AVN content and bioaccessibility.",66,99,1,0,1,99,2,0,1,2,138
"The effect of extrusion treatments on oat gelatinization, microstructure, and macroproperties were important during twin-screw extrusion. In this work, single factor and orthogonal experiments were conducted to evaluate gelatinization degree, expansion ratio, water solubility index, and water absorption index of oat powder before and after extrusion. Results indicated that the optimum gelatinization degree was 96.92% under the conditions of 18% moisture content, 155 degrees C barrel temperature, and 150rpm screw rotating speed. According to appearance by scanning electron micrograph, the extruded oat changed from the original tightly wrapped texture to spongy and porous form with lower gelatinization temperature (88.00 degrees C) than those without extrusion (91.35 degrees C). Rapid viscosity analysis showed that extruded oat became more stable and easier to gelatinization, which was consistent to the in vitro digestion experiment, suggesting extruded oat could be applied as ready-to-eat food in the further application. Practical applicationsThe purpose of this research was aimed to optimize the extrusion and ripening process of oat powder, to explore the effect of curing method on the characteristics of oat powder, and to compare the physical and chemical properties of oat powder before and after extrusion.

"Peptide profiles of hydrolyzed oat proteins and the susceptibility of their polypeptides to proteolytic cleavages were determined using peptidomic analysis. In addition, antioxidant activities were also measured. Proteins isolates were first extracted with carbohydrases, Viscozyme or Cellulase and then hydrolyzed with proteases (Alcalase, Papain, Protamex, Flavourzyme). Amongst the eight hydrolysates, Viscozyme-proteins hydrolyzed with Papain showed the highest ability to quench ABTS(center dot+) radicals (866.9 +/- 10.6 mu M TE/g) and to chelate ferrous ions (75 +/- 0.4%) while displaying the second strongest activity for ROO' radicals (396.7 +/- 14.0 mu M TE/g). Peptidomics analysis showed that the higher activity of papain hydrolysate in most assays was related to its greater proteolytic action on main proteins (avenin, 11S- and 12S-globulins) compared to other proteases. In addition, the number of peptides identified in the Papain digest of proteins extracted with Viscozyme was about half relative to the number in proteins from bran treated with Cellulase and digested with the same protease. This was likely because the carbohydrases differently affected polypeptide secondary structures.",68,1,99,0,0,-1,1,1,2,1,170
"Oat is rich in a wide range of phytochemicals with various physico-chemical, colloidal and interfacial properties. These characteristics are likely to influence human lipid metabolism and the subsequent effect on health following oat consumption. The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of oat materials varying in complexity on the lipolysis process. The composition, structure and digestibility of different lipid systems (emulsions, oil bodies and oil enriched in phytosterols) were determined. The surface activities of phytosterols were examined using the pendant drop technique. Differences in lipid digestibility of the oat oil emulsions and the oil bodies were clearly seen. Also, the digestion of sunflower oil was reduced proportionally to the concentration of phytosterols present. This may be due to their interfacial properties as demonstrated by the pendant drop experiments.

"Oat is the nutritious crop containing various compounds with antioxidant properties, such as polyphenols. In this study, we investigated the effect of germination and ultrafiltration process on polyphenol and avenanthramide contents in oat as well as their cytoprotective effect. Germination of oat for 48 hr significantly increased avenanthramide (5.5 to 11.3 mg/g) and polyphenol (115 to 155 mg GAE/g) contents. The compounds were more concentrated after ultrafiltration using 10 kDa membranes (polyphenol, 206 GAE/g; avenanthramide, 18 mg/g). In addition, oat extracts significantly reduced the cellular ROS level against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) stimulation in HepG2 cells. In the mechanistic study, oat extracts induced Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus by inhibition of Keap1 expression, resulting into upregulation of gamma-GCS and NQO1. In conclusion, oat germination and ultrafiltration processes increased the polyphenol content, including that of avenanthramide. These extracts protected cells from t-BHP by radical scavenging activities and induced Nrf2 pathway activation. Practical applications This study presents the method for avenanthramide-concentrated extract which is unique bioactive compounds in oat. In addition, antioxidant activity and their mechanisms of the avenanthramide-enriched extracts were evaluated. The polyphenol compounds including avenanthramide were found to increase after germination and ultrafiltration, thereby improving the radical scavenging ability.

"The study aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory activity of oligopeptides derived from oat (Avena nuda L.) (OOPs). Healthy female BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to five groups, given deionized water (control) and 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg body weight (BW) of OOPs daily by intragastric administration. Seven assays were performed to determine the immunomodulatory effects of OOPs on immune organ ratios, cellular and humoral immune responses, macrophage phagocytosis, and natural killer (NK) cell activity. Spleen T lymphocyte subpopulations (by flow cytometry), serum cytokine and immunoglobulin levels (by multiplex sandwich immunoassays) were determined to evaluate how OOPs affected the immune system. Our results showed that OOPs could significantly improve innate and adaptive immune responses in mice through the enhancement of cell-mediated and humoral immunity, macrophage phagocytosis capacity, and NK cell activity. We concluded that the immunomodulatory effects might be attributed to increased T and Th cell percentages, serum interferon (IFN)-, interleukin (IL)-1 , IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secretions as well as immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgG, and IgM productions.

"This study investigated the effects of milk solution or milk proteins (casein and whey protein) on the bioaccessibility and antioxidant activity of oat phenolics during in vitro gastric and pancreatic digestion. During digestion, most of oat phenolics were partially degraded by alkaline pH of pancreatic fluid (pH 7.5). For phenolic acids, both milk solution and milk protein only had a slight influence on their bioaccessibility, while exhibited a significant effect on antioxidant activity of oat phenolic extracts and bioaccessibility of avenanthramides (AVs), a kind of bioactive phenols exclusively found in oats. The antioxidant activity and bioaccessibility of AVs were decreased by adding milk and casein, while significantly improved when mixed with milk whey protein. Remarkably, the bioaccessibility of AV 2c, which had the highest antioxidant activity among all phenolic compounds detected in oats, increased above 360% after intestinal digestion by mixing with whey protein. This result suggested the possibility of protecting AVs against digestive alteration and oxidation by milk whey protein. Practical Application In recent years, oats are often consumed with milk under different conditions of preparation, and there have been many oat milk products manufactured by food companies all over the world. The results of this paper showed that the adding of milk may reduce the absorption and antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from oat. However, the antioxidant activity and bioaccessibility of oat phenolics were significantly increased when mixed with milk whey protein, suggesting that oats could be consumed with milk whey protein to improve their functional properties.",72,1,99,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,249
"Three types of oat beta-glucan conjugates were prepared through Maillard reaction between oat beta-glucan and L-glutamine (dipeptiven and L-glutathione). The structural properties of the beta-glucan conjugates were compared using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and their molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The rheological property, emulsifying property, swelling power, and fat binding capacity of beta-glucan conjugates were evaluated. The results indicated that the beta-glucan conjugates were successfully obtained by bonding beta-glucan with the amino acid/peptides. The molecular weight of oat beta-glucan, and its conjugates with c-glutamine, dipeptiven, and glutathione was 119.5, 295.5, 317.6, and 321.0 kDa, respectively. beta-glucan conjugates (5% w/v) exhibited a shear thinning behavior at 20 degrees C when oat beta-glucan showed Newtonian fluid behavior over the entire measured shear rates. The apparent viscosity of oat beta-glucan increased largely after Maillard reaction, and the beta-glucan-dipeptiven conjugate (beta G-D) showed the highest apparent viscosity. The emulsifying property, swelling power and fat binding capacity of beta-glucan conjugates were enhanced compared with that of oat beta-glucan, and beta G-D showed the highest emulsifying property, swelling power and fat binding capacity. This phenomenon might be related to the fact that beta G-D possessed highest apparent viscosity. The results revealed the possible changes of oat beta-glucans during food processing, and will provide theoretical supports for the application of beta-glucans as functional ingredients for food industry.",73,0,99,99,99,1,1,0,1,3,225
"Oat starch granules were subjected to ultrasound treatment using either a 20 kHz horn sonicator at intensities of 39, 48, 63 W/cm(2) or an ultrasound bath operating at an intensity of 5 W/cm(2) for 10 and 20 min. Morphological, structural and functional properties of native and sonicated samples were investigated. SEM micrographs revealed the presence of fissures and pores on the surface of starch granules treated with the horn sonicator. An obvious size reduction was also observed at the highest sonication intensity. Ultrasound treatment increased the amylose content, swelling power, solubility, Transmittance, water, and lipid holding capacity; while the gel hardness diminished after sonication. The syneresis results revealed that higher amounts of water were expelled from the sonicated starch gels during 5 days of storage as compared to the native counterpart. The onset, peak and conclusion temperatures of gelatinization increased; while, the gelatinization temperature range decreased due to sonication. A decrease in the degree of crystallinity as well as the enthalpy of gelatinization demonstrated that the crystalline structures of oat starch granules were destroyed to some extent upon sonication, while the A-type crystalline pattern remained unchanged.",74,0,99,99,0,1,1,0,2,2,186
"Avenanthramides are amides, with a phenylalkenoic acid (PA) and an anthranilic acid (AA) subunit, which are secondary metabolites of oat. Oat seeds were germinated, extracted, and the avenanthramides analysed by a combination of UHPLC with ion trap and high resolution ESI-MS. Typical fragmentation pathways with corresponding diagnostic fragments belonging to the PA and AA subunits were identified and summarised in a decision guideline. Based on these findings 28 unique avenanthramides were annotated in the oat seed(ling) extracts, including the new avenanthramide 6f (with a 4/5-methoxy AA subunit). Avenanthramide content increased by 25 times from seed to seedling. Avenanthramides 2p, 2c, and 2f, which are commonly described as the major avenanthramides, represented less than 20% of the total content in the seedlings. Future quantitative analyses should, therefore, include a wider range of avenanthramides to avoid underestimation of the total avenanthramide content.",75,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,1,4,140
"Wholegrain oats are known to modulate the human gut microbiota and have prebiotic properties (increase the growth of some health-promoting bacterial genera within the colon). Research to date mainly attributes these effects to the fibre content; however, oat is also a rich dietary source of polyphenols, which may contribute to the positive modulation of gut microbiota. In vitro anaerobic batch-culture experiments were performed over 24 h to evaluate the impact of two different doses (1 and 3 % (w/v)) of oat bran, matched concentrations of beta-glucan extract or polyphenol mix, on the human faecal microbiota composition using 16S RNA gene sequencing and SCFA analysis. Supplementation with oats increased the abundance of Proteobacteria (P <0 center dot 01) at 10 h, Bacteroidetes (P <0 center dot 05) at 24 h and concentrations of acetic and propionic acid increased at 10 and 24 h compared with the NC. Fermentation of the 1 % (w/v) oat bran resulted in significant increase in SCFA production at 24 h (86 (sd 27) v. 28 (sd 5) mm; P <0 center dot 05) and a bifidogenic effect, increasing the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium unassigned at 10 h and Bifidobacterium adolescentis (P <0 center dot 05) at 10 and 24 h compared with NC. Considering the beta-glucan treatment induced an increase in the phylum Bacteroidetes at 24 h, it explains the Bacteriodetes effects of oats as a food matrix. The polyphenol mix induced an increase in Enterobacteriaceae family at 24 h. In conclusion, in this study, we found that oats increased bifidobacteria, acetic acid and propionic acid, and this is mediated by the synergy of all oat compounds within the complex food matrix, rather than its main bioactive beta-glucan or polyphenols. Thus, oats as a whole food led to the greatest impact on the microbiota.",76,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,298
"Ice cream is one of the most popular dairy foods in the world. But it has long been recognized as a high-calorie food and may not be suitable for certain segments of the population. Oat-based food products are considered as functional foods due to its rich beta-glucan. A symbiotic oat-based frozen yogurt (SOFY) containing fermented oat, probiotics, and inulin (prebiotic) was developed, and its effects on serum lipids in rats were evaluated. The new product had 4.10% protein, 8.50% fat, and 2.10% fiber, respectively. Bifidobacterium remained 10(6) CFU/ml up to 8 weeks. Triglycerides levels of the rats fed with 30% or 35% SOFY were significantly lower than that of the control group (p < 0.05). Serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels of experimental rat groups decreased with increased SOFY, and the difference was very significant between group with 35% SOFY and control groups (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in high-density lipoprotein between each two groups (p > 0.05). Hepatic cell cords of rats after administration of SOFY showed orderly manner and normal hepatocyte morphology compared with those of rats in control group. Results indicated that consumption of oat-based frozen yogurt could lower serum lipids levels in rats.",77,0,-1,1,1,1,3,1,1,0,201
"Background and objectives Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a carcinogenic and nephrotoxic mycotoxin produced by various Penicillium and Aspergillus species. Cereal grains, including oats, are among the food sources that can be contaminated with OTA. Grains of twelve oat cultivars grown in seven environments were inoculated with P. verrucosum and incubated at 0.90 a(w) and 22.5 degrees C for 7 weeks. Our objectives were to (a) determine the effect of cultivar and growing environment on OTA contamination in oat grain and (b) identify oat grain characteristics associated with OTA accumulation. Findings The effect of the cultivar was significant in two of the environments considered. When data from all seven environments were combined for analysis, significant differences among oat cultivars were also observed. Grain composition and grain physical characteristics were determined to identify characteristics associated with OTA accumulation. We found that test weight, groat percent, the proportion of plump groats, and groat oil content were significantly correlated with the level of OTA accumulation in the grains. Conclusions Significant differences among genotypes for level of OTA accumulation suggest that cultivars with lower levels of OTA accumulation can be used to help mitigate risks of OTA contamination in oat grain. Significance and novelty: This study is the first to report differences among oat cultivars for OTA accumulation.",78,1,1,99,1,-1,3,1,0,1,213
"Background and objectives The study aimed to characterize the effect of oatmeal on the texture, water mobility, and starch retrogradation properties in Chinese steamed bread (CSB). Oatmeal substitution was set as 0%, 10%, and 30%. Findings With the addition of oatmeal in CSB, higher hardness and chewiness and lower resilience were observed compared to the control (p < 0.05); CSB with addition of oatmeal exhibited a lower rate of increase in hardness than that of the control. Oatmeal increased the water holding capacity of CSB and restricted water migration, which resulted in a lower content of immobilized water (S-22, 76.72%-77.03%) and higher content of free water (S-23, 1.01%-1.07%) in NMR. Results from differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and fourier transform infrared suggested that with the increase in oatmeal, the enthalpy and the relative crystallinity of CSB reduced. The addition of oatmeal retarded a stable and ordered state of starch structure formed in CSB during storage at room temperature. Oatmeal decreased the starch retrogradation rate constant k and CSB with 30% of addition of oatmeal had the lowest k value (10.1), indicating its inhibitory effect on the formation of starch crystals. Conclusions Our findings revealed that oatmeal could increase the free water of CSB and restrict water migration, thus retarding starch retrogradation in CSB. Significance and novelty: Oatmeal could effectively inhabit water migration and starch retrogradation of CSB,consequently inhibiting the staling,and there could be a potential utility of oatmeal in the development of flour-based food products.",79,1,0,1,99,1,3,0,1,1,245
"The nutritional components in oat and tartary buckwheat had been assessed to have cholesterol-lowering effects. However, The effect of oat and tartary buckwheat based-food (OF) on cholesterol-lowering and gut microbiota in hypercholesterole hamsters was still limited studied because they are usually consumed in whole gran as well as after being processed. In this study, normal diets, high fat diet (HFD) with/without OF were fed to hamsters for 30 days respectively and growth parameters, metabolic parameters, and gut microbiota were investigated, respectively. It was found that OF significantly decreased plasma total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), lowered liver TC, cholesterol ester (CE), and triglycerides (TG) concentrations, and increased fecal weight and bile acids (BA) concentrations, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). Moreover, the concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were significantly increased in hamsters fed with OF, compared with HFD (p < 0.05). OF changed the overall structure of gut microbiota. The relative abundances of Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were decreased and the relative abundance of Eubacteriaceae was increased, compared with HFD. These results suggested that OF could reduce the concentrations of plasma lipid by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in liver and promoting excretions of fecal lipid and BA. And it also increased SCFAs and modulated the gut microbiota effectively to exert the hypocholesterolemic effects.",80,1,1,0,0,99,2,0,2,1,220
"Eight Indian oat cultivars collected from different areas were investigated for the presence of bioactive compounds, their antioxidant capacities and in-vitro DNA damage protection activity. Different assays were used for quantification of antioxidant activities in oat cultivars. Preliminary analysis revealed that all oat cultivars (cv.) were rich in specific phytochemicals as their extracts showed the presence of coumarins, saponins, flavonoids, flavones, proteins, tocols, -glucan and carbohydrates. The total phenolic and condensed tannin contents of oat cultivars ranged between 7.6 and 16.8mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) g(-1) and 27.3-107.3mg catechin equivalent (CE) 100g(-1), respectively. Comparisons of antioxidant activity of all oat cultivars showed that OS-6 cv. possessed the highest inhibition towards 2, 2-diphenyl-1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(+)) radicals and also higher reducing power (8.4mg quercetin equivalent g(-1)). All the extracts protected DNA from damaging effect produced during Fenton's reaction as confirmed by the presence of DNA bands. The results indicated that phenolic compounds are potent radical scavengers as phenolic content was positively correlated to various antioxidant assays studied. The information provided in the present study will help plant breeders to select specific cv. which is rich in phenolics and other important bioactive compounds.",81,1,99,1,99,0,2,0,1,2,195
"The use of grain proteins in various types of meat products is common practice. A reliable detection of these food ingredients is required to control specifications and regarding food fraud and allergenic potential. Consequently, a sensitive HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous detection of barley, maize, oats, rice, rye and wheat proteins in meat products was developed. After protein extraction and tryptic digestion, three to four selected marker peptides for each grain species were measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Emulsion-type sausages with grain-based protein concentrations in the range of 5-1000 mg/kg and blank values were produced. The limits of detection of the method were <= 5 or <= 10 mg grain protein/kg meat product for each grain species and no false-positive or -negative results were obtained. The delectability of the marker peptides only slightly decreased after storage and grilling of sausages, whereas the influence of the canning process was noticeably higher.",82,1,99,99,99,1,2,0,0,3,148
"Extruded snack products were made from an oat fiber-corn flour matrix fortified with 1.5% (w/w) curcuminoids (750mg curcuminoids/100 g) to improve the solubility and stability of curcuminoids. The effects of extruder feed moisture content (21%, 28%, and 35%) and screw speed (200 and 300 rpm) on the extrusion parameters and physical properties of final snacks were investigated. Curcuminoids lost during extrusion and curcuminoids loss during subsequent drying of extrudates were analyzed, to separate the losses occurring in each unit process. Drying post extrusion (at 50 degrees C for 4hr) was essential to obtain a crunchy shelf stable product (5% moisture). Curcuminoids loss during extrusion was from 17% to 84%, with high loss for the extrusion with low feed moisture content (21%). A further curcuminoids loss of 4% to 44% occurred during drying, with much higher loss for the extrudate with high moisture content. Total curcuminoids retained after extrusion and drying was 12% to 41% (59% to 88% loss), equivalent to 180 to 616 mg curcuminoids retained per 100 g snack, levels within recommended daily dose. Curcuminoids retained after drying was stable during 80 days of storage at 25 degrees C. The results highlighted the importance of understanding the impact of each unit process separately (for example, extrusion and drying) on the stability of curcuminoids for the development of healthier extruded snacks.",83,1,99,0,1,0,2,0,2,1,221
"A chitinase was purified from naked oat (Avena chinensis) seeds using simple chromatographic techniques. Its molecular weight and isoelectric point were determined as 35 kDa and 8.9, respectively. The purified chitinase exhibited specific activity of 3.6 U/mg and 15.6% yield using colloidal chitin as substrate. Partial amino acid sequence analysis and homology search indicated that it probably belonged to Class I plant chitinase, glycosyl hydrolase family 19. With chitin as substrate, the optimum pH and temperature of the chitinase were pH 7.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The chitinase was remarkably stable from 30 degrees C up to 50 degrees C, but was inactivated at high temperatures above 85 degrees C. Antifungal activity in vitro tests demonstrated this purified chitinase had potent, dose-dependent inhibitory activity against the fungi Panus conchatus and Trichoderma reesei.",84,99,99,1,1,0,2,0,1,2,133
"In this study, the effect of extrusion temperature and screw speed on the nutritional properties of the extrudates was evaluated by using a response surface methodology. The total, soluble, insoluble dietary fiber, beta-glucan, resistant starch, and total starch contents were evaluated through enzymatic assays. The processing parameters affected the content of all constituents of the flour mixture, except for beta-glucan. The total starch content, insoluble dietary fiber, and resistant starch were significantly decreased with increasing temperature and screw speed (until 13, 12, and 97%, respectively). The extrusion parameters had a positive effect on total dietary fiber content (increased this parameter up to 29%) when compared with the raw material, that is, oat and rice blend, causing changes from the insoluble to soluble dietary fibers. In the electron microscopic analysis, the structure of all extrudates showed to be homogeneous and compact with irregular surfaces.",85,99,99,1,1,1,3,0,0,2,143
"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a possible human carcinogen with its potent nephrotoxicity and has been found in many agricultural commodities particularly in oats and its processed foods including oat-based infant cereals. While OTA is stable under most thermal processing conditions, alkaline pH can increase the reduction of OTA. In this study, the effect of direct steam injection (DSI) process along with the absence and presence baking soda (0.5% and 1% of solid contents) on the reduction of OTA in oat-based infant cereals was investigated. Food-grade oat flour was spiked with OTA (100 mu g/kg) and equilibrated overnight followed by preparation of slurry by adding water to reach 5% solid content. Then the slurry was processed by DSI at 85 degrees C and 121 degrees C followed by spray drying at 210 degrees C. Greater reduction of OTA in DSI processed oat-based infant cereals was observed at higher process temperature to result in 20-28% reduction. In addition, the reduction of OTA increased with increasing amounts of baking soda. These results suggest that OTA may be reduced significantly by DSI process, which can be applied to commercial production of oat-based infant cereals. Baking soda may also help to reduce OTA amount in cereal-based infant cereals during thermal processing.",86,99,-1,0,99,1,1,1,1,2,206
"Oat protein isolate is nutritious but with poor processing functionality. Pleurotus ostreatus beta-glucan with good processing functionality can be conjugated with oat protein isolate via Maillard reaction, leading to an improved utilization of protein in food industry. Therefore, we produced conjugate with oat protein isolate and Pleurotus ostreatus beta-glucan via Maillard reaction under controlled dry-heating conditions. The formation of conjugates with high molecular weight was identified by a new band of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The analysis of amino acid composition showed that cysteine and lysine were the dominant Maillard reaction sites of oat protein isolate and Pleurotus ostreatus beta-glucan. Changes in spatial configuration of conjugates caused reduction in their surface hydrophobicity of proteins and intrinsic fluorescence intensity. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of conjugates suggested that Maillard reaction could cause the C=O stretching vibration, as well as the C-H and N-H deformation vibration. Circular dichroism analysis indicated that the secondary structure of conjugates was altered by decreasing the contents of a-helix and beta-sheet and increasing the contents of beta-turn and random coil. The surface structure of conjugates was loose and porous using scanning electron microscope. Furthermore, Maillard reaction could improve the solubility, emulsifying property and thermal stability of oat protein isolate. Our findings confirm the potential of protein-carbohydrate conjugate formed by Maillard reaction, to improve the application of instable but valuable proteins in food industry.",87,1,1,1,-1,1,4,1,0,0,227
"This study aimed to investigate the effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on the physicochemical characteristics of blended low-protein wheat (LW) and oat flour. Additionally, quality changes in noodles made from blends treated with HHP were investigated. Crude protein and fiber contents of LW were not affected by HHP; however, those of blends were significantly higher than those of LW (p < 0.05). Water-holding capacity (WHC) of blends increased with HHP treatment. The peak viscosity of LW did not differ significantly because of HHP, and the peak and final viscosities of blends increased upon oat flour addition. The hardness, gumminess, chewiness of noodles made using LW improved with the addition of oat flour combined with HHP. The results indicated that the use of blends containing LW and oat flour as well as HHP treatment improved the quality and properties of noodles made using LW.",88,1,99,99,99,0,1,0,1,3,144
"In view of the growing expectations of meat products consumers (quality and sensory properties), the meat industry must develop functional products to meet the consumer requirements. In the experiment, the influence of oat ?-glucan, canola oil and both on the proximate composition, fatty acid profile, volatile compounds profile and sensory properties of beef burgers was analyzed. The beef tallow replacement by ?-glucan, canola oil or both decreased the SFA and increased PUFA content. The consumption of one portion of product with canola oil and ?-glucan can provide 57.6% of the daily amount of linolenic acid (C18:3n3). Volatile compounds analysis of grilled samples showed the presence of 1-penten-3-one and 2-methylpropanal only in case of groups with canola oil and butane-2-one in ?-glucan group. This strategy improves not only the nutritional value but also the sensory properties and consumer acceptance.

"The gluten content in oat products on the market in the Czech Republic was monitored. The ELISA kit Ridascreen gliadin from R-Biopharm based on the R5 antibody was used for the gliadin determination. Oat products (41 samples), including 21 samples of oat flakes, were tested. Only 6 samples were labelled as gluten-free and it was confirmed that these samples meet the criteria for gluten-free foods. The total of 29 oat products, of which 15 were samples of oat flakes, contained more than 20 mg/kg of gluten. This means that 71% of oat cereal products were contaminated with cereals toxic for people with celiac disease. It was shown that most oat products on the Czech market are not safe for people with gluten intolerance.",90,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,5,0,0,123
"Oats rank sixth in grain production after wheat and maize. Oats are rich in soluble dietary fiber, protein, fat and other nutrients, which can reduce heart disease. Through nutritional analysis of oat products on e-commerce platform, it can be seen that the average content of crude protein is 17%, crude fat is 7%, and B-glucan is 5%. Sulfur-containing amino acids were the most significant amino acids among oat samples. The variation coefficients of methionine and cysteine were 31% and 44% respectively. In this paper, the author analyzes the nutritional value of oat food in e-commerce and economic benefit of internet finance. The financial crisis may be the trigger for the reform of the paper industry, but it will also promote the upgrading of theindustry. At the same time, the empirical results show that Internet finance can effectively support the development of regional economy. The government must speed up the construction of Internet financial ecological environment to guarantee the survival of Internet financial enterprises.

"Purpose - The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of whole oat, oat bran and refined oat incorporation in a high-fat diet (HFD) on cardio-metabolic risk biomarkers in rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Design/methodology/approach - T2DM was induced by feeding male rats with an HFD for 10 weeks, followed by a low dose of streptozotocin. T2DM rats were then divided into four homogeneous groups. Three groups consumed an HFD containing 45 per cent (g/100 g diet) whole oat, oat bran or refined oat. The fourth untreated group (control) received the HFD. Findings - The results showed that whole oat and oat bran, compared with refined oat and control, effectively reduced food intake (p < 0.007), arterial blood pressure (p = 0.0001), glycemia (p < 0.001), insulinemia (p < 0.01), glycosylated haemoglobin (p < 0.001) as well as homeostasis insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p < 0.001). They also improved blood lipid levels and reverse cholesterol transport by reducing serum total cholesterol (p = 0.0001), triacylglycerols (p < 0.05), very-low- (p = 0.0001) and low-density lipoproteins cholesterol contents (p < 0.02) increasing lipids (p < 0.002) and cholesterol excretion (p = 0.0001), and high-density lipoprotein cholesteryl esters (HDL2-CE) concentrations (p = 0.0001) and stimulating lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity (p = 0.0001). Moreover, they attenuated lipid peroxidation by increasing paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) atheroprotective activity (p < 0.05). Originality/value - In T2DM rats, whole oat and particularly, its bran incorporated into an HFD improves arterial blood pressure, glycemic balance and lipid metabolic pathway by reducing hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia and increasing atheroprotective activities of LCAT and PON-1. In contrast, refined oat accentuates the risk factors associated with diabetes.",94,-1,1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,277
"This study was focused on the multigrain flours obtained by milling blends with various amounts of wheat, rye and hulled oat, and on the sourdoughs prepared out of these flours using different commercial starter culture. The folate and total phenol levels and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA) of multigrain flours increased with the addition level of rye and hulled oat. Among the fractions obtained through milling, higher levels of folates were registered in brans, followed by shorts and then by flours. The folate contents in brans and shorts were about of 1-1.4 times higher than in the flours. The sourdough fermentation realized with different commercial starter cultures induced the increase of the total phenols content and DPPH-RSA. The highest levels of folates were obtained when fermenting the flour suspensions with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, followed by samples with Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis and Leuconostoc. The sourdough fermented with Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus plantarum had lower folate contents compared to the corresponding controls obtained through spontaneous fermentation. The obtained results suggest that both the type of cereals used to obtain the flours and the starter culture used to prepare the sourdoughs are suitable tools which worth be used for modulating the nutritional profile of the baking products.",95,99,1,99,1,99,2,0,0,3,211
"Oats have excellent nutritional characteristics and biological activity, and have become a kind of cereal food which attracts wide attention of consumers. Oats contain not only high protein content (15%-20%) but also abundant essential amino acids. Oats nutrients can effectively supplement the physical energy consumption of football players. In this paper, the author analyses the oat protein nutrition and soccer player muscle kinematics simulation. The experimental results show that the algorithm is simplified by a series of feature extractions, and the linear skeleton of the human body is completely extracted. In the course of daily football training, it is easy to cause training injury and damage to all aspects of the body. The pixel coordinates of the collected target points were adjusted, and the muscle impact model under football training was constructed from the perspective of biological force. The biomechanical characteristics of muscle and meat at different training stages can be extracted by the moment on each joint. The simulation results show that the model can effectively analyze football image and kinematics characteristics. The result has certain value for football training image detection and athletes' nutrition analysis.",96,1,0,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,187
"In grass caryopsis, the transfer system developed in the crease area plays a crucial role in endosperm development. Structural variation of the placental vascular bundle, pigment strand, nucellar projection and endosperm cavity were studied in oat amphiploids (4x, 6x, 8x) and parental species (2x, 4x, 6x). Ten characters are used to show multivariate relations between taxa in an ordination space. Two amphiploids, Avena magna x A. longiglumis and A. fatua x A. sterilis appeared to be extremes in a pooled group of oats. Hybrid types form a more compact group in a minimum spanning tree than do their parental species. Amphiploid arithmetic averages and character ranges exceed the corresponding values in parental species. Development of adjacent structures of the transfer system is more correlated than more distant structures. The number of xylem vessels is correlated with the width of the pigment strand (ps) and nucellar projection (np). Elongation growth of ps, np and the endosperm cavity towards endosperm is highly interrelated. Accumulation of starch grains within the endosperm cavity is determined by an anomalous discontinuity of the aleurone layer in this area. 1000-grain weight depends on some characters of the transfer system.",97,-1,0,99,1,0,1,1,2,1,192
"This clinical trial was conducted to assess the lipid-lowering activity of oat noodles by replacing partial staple food (wheat or rice noodle) in normal and mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects. Totally 84 healthy and mild hypercholesterolemic subjects were recruited and divided into 2 groups as experimental (oat noodles) and placebo (wheat noodles) and instructed to consume 100 g of oat noodles or wheat noodles (replacing one or two meals/day) for 10 weeks and followed by 2 weeks of follow up (without noodle consumption). Various anthropometric measurements and biochemical analysis were carried out during initial (baseline), 2nd, 6th, 10th and 12th week (follow-up). Consumption of oat noodles by replacing staple food for 10 weeks significantly reduced (**p < 0.01) the levels of total cholesterol (TC; 17.46%) and low-density lipoprotein LDL-c (19.03%) in both healthy and mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects. However, the hypocholesterolemic effect is significantly higher in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects as compared with normal subjects. A pronounced decline (*p < 0.05) in the levels of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) markers including TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios and blood pressure (SBP; 11.09% and DBP; 7.48%) were observed in oat noodles supplemented subjects as equivalence with the placebo group.

"Background/Objectives Soaking oats overnight in milk renders them ready to eat the next morning, however, it is unknown whether oats prepared this way will retain its relatively low glycaemic and insulinaemic impact. Therefore, we compared the glycaemic, insulinaemic and subjective hunger responses elicited by oats soaked overnight in 110 g skim-milk (ONO) vs. cooked cream of rice cereal (CR), both with and without inclusions. Subjects/Methods The project was performed at two research centers (Toronto, Winnipeg) as two separate studies each using a randomized, cross-over design with similar methods. The glycaemic and insulinaemic responses of overnight-fasted participants without diabetes (males:females: Toronto, 24:16; Winnipeg, 20:20) were measured for 3 h after consuming CR and ONO fed alone (Toronto) or with added sugar, nuts, and seeds (CRsns and ONOsns) (Winnipeg). Participants rated subjective hunger using visual analog scales. Data were analyzed by paired t-test. The primary endpoint was 0-2 h incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for glucose. Results Mean glucose iAUC was 33% less, after ONO than CR (mean difference was 39 (51-27) mmol x min/l, p < 0.0001) and 24% less, after ONOsns than CRsns (mean difference was 43 (65-21) mmol x min/l, p = 0.0003). Serum-insulin iAUC was 33% less, after ONO than CR (mean difference 57 (81-40) pmol x hl, p < 0.0001) and 32% less, after ONOsns than CRsns (966 (1360-572) pmol x h/l, p < 0.0001). In both Toronto and Winnipeg, subjective hunger ratings were similar across the two treatments.

"This study investigated the effect of fermentation on the physicochemical properties of beta-glucans in oat sourdough. Sourdoughs were produced from oat using homo-fermentative lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus plantarum 22134. The contents of total beta-glucan and soluble beta-glucan, the molecular weight (MW) of beta-glucan and the viscosity of the extracted beta-glucans were determined at 0, 4, 8, 10 and 12 h of fermentation. The total beta-glucan content decreased from 4.89% to 4.23% after 12 h of fermentation. The soluble beta-glucan concentration increased from 1.89% to 2.18% and then decreased to 1.97% after 8 h of fermentation. The content of beta-glucans with MW > 10(5) decreased from 0 to 4 h of fermentation, followed by an increase and then a decrease after 8 h. The oat sourdough fermented for 8 h had high viscosity, which could be more beneficial for health and bread texture quality, especially for gluten-free breads.",100,1,99,1,1,99,3,0,0,2,147
"Oat (Avena sativa) bran, a by-product during oat grain processing, is a excellent source of fibre, vitamins and phytochemicals. The health benefits of dietary fibre have long been established. In the present study, the antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of oat bran extracts were investigated. The extracts showed strong 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2 '- azino- bis( 3- ethylbenzothiazoline- 6sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), hydroxyl, superoxide radicals scavenging and reducing power activities in vitro. In addition, the extracts (50 mg/ kg mouse) significantly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and hepatic damage marker enzymes (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase), proinflammatory cytokines as well as elevated SOD, CAT, and GPx enzymes expressions in LPStreated (1 mg/ kg body weight) BALB/c mice. Therefore, the present study strongly suggests that both oat bran extracts could be excellent raw materials for manufacturing functional food due to its protective effect on hepatic liver damage and excellent antioxidant activity.

"Ochratoxin A (OTA) represents one of the most widespread mycotoxins in agricultural commodities in the world and is considered as a possible human carcinogen with its potent nephrotoxicity. Since OTA is stable under most food processing conditions, it has been detected in a variety of cereal grains and their processed products. We investigated the effect of explosive puffing process on the reduction of OTA in rice and oats. Moisture content of rice and oat grains were adjusted to 15% (wet weight basis, wb) and OTA was spiked at 100 mu g/kg. Then the grains were processed by explosive puffing at 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 MPa. The moisture content of puffed rice and oat snacks were in the ranges of 5-8% wb and 6-10% wb, respectively, and the moisture content in the puffed products were decreased with increasing pressure. In addition, decreased bulk density and increased degree of redness (a) were observed with increased explosive puffing pressure. The reduction of OTA concentration in puffed rice and oats were decreased with increasing explosive puffing pressures in the ranges of 15-28% and 38-52%, respectively. These results suggest that OTA in rice and oat may be reduced significantly by explosive puffing process, which can be applied to commercial production of cereal-based snack foods.",102,1,1,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,209
"Despite its excellent nutritional properties, unlike other cereals oat displays poor baking properties and therefore is mainly processed in products like rolled oats or serves as raw material for the functional ingredient beta-glucan. During beta-glucan production, a protein-rich fraction remains as a by-product. Functionalisation of this protein-rich oat-fraction and its application as a valuable food ingredient would improve the sustainability of the process. In the present study, oat protein-enriched cow's milk yoghurt was produced. The main foci were on the characterisation of techno-functional properties, as well as on the analysis of the organoleptic perception and sensory properties by a trained panel. Cow's milk yoghurt, following a traditional formulation with addition of skim milk powder (SMP), served as a reference. Oat protein was incorporated using two preparations: oat protein concentrate (OPC) and oat protein isolate (OPI). Fermentation of yoghurt enriched with SMP, OPC or OPI was monitored via pH-value, formation of lactic acid and rheological measurements. In addition, texture analysis and measurement of syneresis were performed and sensory properties were evaluated. Yoghurt containing SMP showed the highest strength in texture analysis but also a high rate of syneresis. Addition of OPC resulted in a product, which combines nutritional benefits with the sustainable use of the by-product of oat processing as well as improved product quality with respect to syneresis and sensory evaluation, especially mouthfeel. In case of OPI, strong sedimentation took place and high syneresis was observed. It is assumed that the compatibility of oat protein with milk proteins is low, which may be compensated by gelatinisation of starch during yoghurt production. (C) 2018 The Authors.

"contaminated with gluten sources like wheat and barley has recently been shown to significantly complicate confirmation of a GF state. We therefore hypothesize that clinical studies may have inadvertently provided pill-like gluten kernels intermittently to study subjects, leading to adverse outcomes that could potentially explain inconsistencies between study conclusions. To test this theory, potential gluten contamination of oats used in a cross-section of 12 important oat feeding studies has been estimated, done according to descriptions of oats used, published contamination rates for various oat types, and study oat dosages. Expected gluten exposures were found to be at levels to elicit clinical effects in a large portion of CD patients, correlating with observed clinical reaction rates in those studies (P value = .0006). Estimated gluten doses were found insufficient, however, to affect morphological outcomes, whereas only 1 study had 1 case. Our analysis provides a new perspective with which to view oat safety study conclusions and justifies new clinical trials using today's higher-purity GF oats to settle the oat safety for CD patient debate.

"Purpose Liquids have higher ingestion and gastric-emptying rates, resulting in rapid glycemic response. They are also less satiating than solid foods. This study examined if the addition of plant proteins alter postprandial glucose, insulin, triglycerides, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), glycogen-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and appetitive responses to a sugar-sweetened beverage. Methods This was a randomized, crossover acute feeding study consisting of four treatments: chocolate beverage alone (50 g carbohydrate), or added with 24 g oat, pea or rice proteins. Twenty Chinese males (mean +/- SD age 26 +/- 5 years; body mass index 21.5 +/- 1.7 kg/m(2)) ingested the test drink after an overnight fast. Venous blood samples and subjective appetite ratings were collected before test beverage and at fixed intervals for 180 min. Blood biochemical data and appetite ratings were compared using repeated-measures ANOVA. Results Significant interaction effects were found in postprandial glucose excursions (time x protein effects, p = 0.003). Glucose iAUC was lower in pea and rice proteins, although not significantly (p > 0.385). Insulin iAUC was significantly higher in the oat (p = 0.035) and pea (p = 0.036) protein beverages. GIP and GLP-1 release in a sub-sample (n = 10) followed a comparable order as insulin release (p = 0.397 and 0.454, respectively). Significant interaction effects were found in fullness ratings (p = 0.024), and a trend of greater suppression of hunger and desire-to-eat was also documented (p = 0.088 and 0.080, respectively). Conclusions Plant proteins altered the glycemic and appetitive responses of Asian males to a sugar-sweetened beverage. Food-based interventions are useful in promoting glycemic control.",105,99,1,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,261
"Foaming ability of oat protein isolate (OPI) was analysed at pH 4 and 7. Foaming properties were influenced by partial hydrolysis with trypsin (OPT) and alcalase (OPA). The viscoelasticity of the protein film, the interactions between the protein molecules, and the network forming within the protein film were analysed by interfacial rheology. At pH 7, foams made of OPI and OPT were found to be stable with OPI showing the fastest foaming ability. At pH 4, the foaming properties of OPI were found to be poor due to limited solubility. The specific cleavage pattern of trypsin resulted in peptides with improved foaming properties, especially at pH 4, resulting in a homogenous foam structure, a fast foaming ability, and a highly viscoelastic interfacial film. The formation of a thick steric protein layer at pH 7 and the formation of strong hydrophobic interactions at pH 4 were found to be the dominating foam stabilisation mechanisms. In conclusion, oat protein may serve as a food ingredient with targeted functional properties.",106,1,1,0,99,1,3,0,1,1,167
"Phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity of 20 oat genotypes differing in hull color were investigated. Phenolic aldehydes, phenolic acids, avenanthramides and mono-, and diglycerides were identified in the soluble phenolic fraction of the genotypes. The bound phenolic fraction proved to be less diverse with phenolic aldehydes, phenolic acids and a ferulic acid dehydrodimer detected. Investigating the scavenging capacity of the hull and groat toward 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), an increased antioxidant activity (AOA) of hull compared to groats and a color dependence of the hull AOA could be observed. Principal component analysis on the determined variables revealed that the black-hulled samples were different from the white ones due to their increased phenolic content detected in the hull. However, reddish-hulled varieties were grouping with the accessions of the other colored groups. In addition, a distinction between spring and winter cultivars was also observed.",107,99,0,99,99,99,0,0,1,4,140
"Oat is a cereal with a long history of cultivation and great importance in human nutrition, not only because of its starch and protein content, but also because of its substantial fat content with a relatively high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. The fat content, fatty acid composition, and nutritional value of six new oat cultivars were evaluated. Total fat content ranged from 2.9 g/100 g (Korok) to 6.1 g/100 g of sample (Kamil). Naked oat cultivars had significantly higher fat content than hulled oat cultivars (p < 0.0001). The most abundant fatty acids in all tested oat cultivars were linoleic (34.6-38.2%), oleic (30.7-32.2%), and palmitic acid (21.4-22.7%). Naked cultivars had significantly higher amounts of linoleic (p(yellow) = 0.0125, P-black = 0.0472) and lower amounts of palmitic acid (p(yellow) = 0.0019, p(black) = 0.0031) than hulled oat cultivars. All analysed oat samples had low atherogenic (0.17-0.19) and thrombogenic indices (0.30-0.34).

"Background and objectives The variability in gluten in non-gluten-containing grains (NGCG) processed using two preparation schemes was evaluated with the aim of minimizing effects of sample heterogeneity on gluten determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The relationship between gluten concentration as determined by ELISA and visually assessed contamination of NGCG with wheat, durum, barley, and rye was investigated. Findings Conclusions Low variability between duplicate aliquots taken from test portions (0-30.6% relative standard deviation [RSD]) demonstrated the ELISA itself was precise. In the first scheme, variability among test portions ranged from 1% to 143% RSD, with only half in the range of 1-50%. Using scheme 2, variability in gluten among test portions ranged from 1% to 85% RSD, with more than three quarters in the range of 1-50%. High lipid content hemp seed was a particular challenge to grind, and this was reflected in higher variability in gluten results between test portions (mean RSD = 61%). Subsampling ground samples using rotary sample division and the use of a 1-g test portion in scheme 2 decreased the variability of gluten results for most samples. At concentrations relevant to existing thresholds of gluten contamination (e.g. 20 mg/kg), there was no relationship between gluten concentration in NGCG and cereal contamination as determined by visual inspection. Significance and novelty This study provides guidance on how to improve the analysis of gluten contamination in NGCG by ELISA and describes the absence of a relationship between ELISA-determined gluten and the visual assessment of contamination in NGCG.",109,0,0,1,0,-1,1,1,3,0,250
"Practical applications The aim of this study was to develop an innovative low-fat beef burgers with canola oil and oat beta-glucan in order to substitute tallow and evaluate the influence of that particular modification on physico-chemical parameters and consumers' acceptance. According to the results, replacing 40% of tallow with canola oil and 4% of burger fats with 30% oat beta-glucan concentrate is technologically feasible for the low-fat beef burgers production. Results showed that replacement of tallow by oil and beta-glucan influence on cholesterol level reduction and increase in WHC value of product. Tallow replacement by canola oil and beta-glucan has no influence on most of texture parameters but changes the volatile compounds profile of product. Consumers accept sensory parameters of low-fat beef burgers with oil and beta-glucan. In conclusion, tallow replacement by canola oil and beta-glucan concentrate has a positive influence on the pro-health and technological properties of low-fat beef burgers. The aim of this study was to develop an innovative low-fat beef burger with canola oil (n-3 fatty acids source) and oat beta-glucan (pro-health hydrocolloid balance for physico-chemical parameters) in order to substitute tallow and evaluate the influence of that particular modification on physico-chemical parameters and consumer acceptance. ' requirements, have introduced the production of low-fat meat products and the replacement of traditional fats. Replacing beef tallow with canola oil and oat beta-glucan concentrate is technologically feasible for manufacturing low-fat beef burgers, and can be recommended for obtaining low-fat meat products. This solution allows the modification of meat products that can be used as a source of oat beta-glucan in a diet with a healthy fatty acid profile. The proposed recapture modification can be recommended as a good strategy to produce healthier low-fat beef burgers, while at the same time retaining consumer acceptance on a level comparable to traditional burgers.",110,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,301
"Practical applications beta-glucan was isolated from eight Indian oat cultivars (OL-9, OL-10, Kent, OS-6, OS-7, OS-346, HFO-114, and PLP-1) and characterized for its composition, functional, rheological, morphological, and x-ray diffraction properties. The isolated beta-glucans had ash and protein contents of 1.10%-2.60% and 3.1%-4.7%, respectively. Among various minerals studied, magnesium and cobalt were found in higher concentrations. Water-binding and foaming capacities of beta-glucans ranged between 2.15-5.00 g/g and 20%-48%, respectively. The properties examined were found to be cultivar-dependent. Among all cultivars, OL-10 cv. beta-glucan was significantly (p < 0.05) different in exhibiting the highest moisture, ash, protein, lightness, bulk density, and foam stability. Scanning electron micrographs revealed the porous and spongy appearance of beta-glucans with an irregular particle shape. The rheological measurements of beta-glucan suspensions from all cultivars indicated their shear thinning and viscoelastic behavior. Oat beta-glucan has numerous health benefits along with desirable functional properties to be used as an ingredient in food industry. A comparative study of various compositional, functional, structural, and rheological properties of beta-glucan isolated from different oat cultivars will help in selection of a cultivar suitable for imparting desirable characteristics to various food products.",111,0,1,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,188
"Gas cell stabilization in dough by its aqueous phase constituents is arguably more important in non-wheat than in wheat dough due to weaker protein networks in the former. Dough liquor (DL), a model for the dough aqueous phase, was isolated from fermented wheat, rye, barley, and oat doughs by ultracentrifugation. DL composition (protein, lipid, arabinoxylan, beta-glucan) and air/water interfacial functionality [foaming, viscosity, surface tension, surface dilatational modulus (E)] were related to bread quality. Poor foaming and low E of wheat DL were ascribed to lipids and proteins co-occurring at the interface. Nonetheless, the presence of a gluten network resulted in high-quality wheaten breads. Homogeneous and heterogeneous crumb structures of rye and barley breads, respectively, were attributed to high and low E values of their respective DLs. High lipid content and low surface tension of oat DL indicated a lipid-dominated interface, which may explain the heterogeneous crumb structure of oat breads.",112,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,1,4,150
"Depletion flocculation is a well-known instability mechanism that can occur in oil-in-water emulsions when the concentration of non-adsorbed polysaccharide exceeds a certain level. This critical flocculation concentration depends on the molecular characteristics of the polysaccharide molecules, such as their molecular weight and hydrodynamic radius. In this study, a range of analytical methods (dynamic shear rheology, optical microscopy, and static light-scattering) were used to investigate the interaction between lipid droplets and polysaccharides (guar gum and beta-glucans) of varying weight-average molecular weight and hydrodynamic radius, and concentration. The aim of this work was to see if the health benefits of soluble fibers like beta-glucans could be explained by their influence on the structure and digestibility of lipid emulsions. The apparent viscosity of the emulsions increased with increasing polysaccharide concentration, molecular weight, and hydrodynamic radius. Droplet flocculation was observed in the emulsions only at certain polysaccharide concentrations, which was attributed to a depletion effect. In addition, the water-soluble components in oat flakes, flour, and bran were extracted using aqueous solutions, to examine their impact on emulsion stability and properties. Then, the rate and extent of lipolysis of a sunflower oil-in-water emulsion in the presence of these oat extracts were monitored using the pH-stat method. However, the inhibition of lipolysis was not linearly related to the viscosity of the oat solutions. The water-soluble extracts of beta-glucan collected from oat flakes had a significant inhibitory effect on lipolysis. The results of this study increase our understanding of the possible mechanisms influencing the impact of oat constituents on lipid digestion. This work also highlights the importance of considering the molecular properties of polysaccharides, and not just their impact on solution viscosity.",113,99,0,0,1,0,1,0,3,1,275
"The aim of this study was to investigate calcium chloride-induced gelatinization of oat starch, and its effects on the properties of oat starch-based Pickering emulsions. The starch granules were gelatinized in CaCl2 for up to 24 h and the results indicate that the salt-induced gelatinization of oat granules is not a surface phenomenon, as gelatinization and dissolution of the whole starch granule was observed. The degree of swelling differed with time and for emulsions the creaming layer changed depending on the length of salt-induced gelatinization; the least dense layer being observed after 30 min of gelatinization. The study also included OSA-modified starch. OSA modification of oat starch led to a slight decrease in the droplet size in the resulting emulsion, but the macroscopic properties of the emulsions made with OSA-modified and non-OSA-modified oat starch granules were similar. It was also investigated whether emulsions made from non-gelatinized oat starch could be gelatinized in situ. This was found to be possible and led to encapsulation of the oil. The gelatinized emulsions could be dialyzed and lyophilized without loss of oil. Leading to dry emulsions that was reformed upon reconstitution with water. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"Milk protein concentrate (MPC; 0 g, 5 g, and 10 g) was added to two commercially available oat products (instant oats and steel cut oats) to examine how MPC addition, and consequent changes in meal formulation, manipulates both gastric lumen viscosity and intestinal carbohydrate-digestion kinetics, in vitro. We used the TNO Intestinal Model-1 (TIM-1) to simulate gastrointestinal digestion of the oats-based meals. Meals containing 5 g or 10 g MPC yielded significantly less total bioaccessible sugar compared with those containing 0 g MPC, while the rate of starch digestion was significantly higher in meals containing 5 g or 10 g MPC. The TIM-1 was coupled with fluorescence spectroscopy and a luminescent molecular rotor to report changes in gastric viscosity in situ, showing that the gastric viscosity was higher in the meals containing MPC. Those findings suggest that MPC in oats-based meals significantly modifies the kinetics of carbohydrate digestion and increases gastric viscosity. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"BACKGROUND: A beverage was developed using beta-glucan and whey protein isolate (WPI). The sensory attributes and changes of the physiochemical properties (pH value, total acidity, total soluble solids, sugar-acid ratio, color, viscosity, turbidity, and browning index) of the beverage during 48-h storage were evaluated by comparison with the commercial product and a blank sample. RESULTS: The sweetness, smoothness, and overall acceptance of the developed beverage were similar to the commercial and blank samples. The suspension stability of the developed beverage was significantly better than that of the commercial products. The total acidity of the beverage decreased considerably after 36-h storage. Regarding color changes, the three samples showed a significant increase in L and b values after 6 h of storage. The viscosity of the developed beverage rose significantly after 24 h of storage. The increase in the concentration of beta-glucan in the mixed hydrocolloid caused a significant elevation in the levels of viscosity. CONCLUSION:The sensory and physicochemical analysis results obtained by the panelists revealed that the developed beverage was acceptable and possessed stable physicochemical attributes.

"The positive influence of animal-based protein supplementation during muscle-damaging exercise has been widely studied. However, the effects of plant-based proteins remain unclear and require further clarification. This study investigated the protective role of oat protein against exercise induced muscle damage (EIMD), subsequent inflammation, and loss of performance induced by downhill running. Subjects consumed either oat protein (25 g protein) or a placebo for 14 days prior to a downhill running test and then for 4 days thereafter. Treatments with oat protein for 19 days markedly alleviated eccentric exercise induced skeletal muscle soreness, and reduced the elevation of plasma IL-6 concentrations and serum creatine kinase, myoglobin and C reactive protein contents. In addition, oat protein supplementation significantly inhibited limb edema following damaging exercise, and the adverse effects on muscle strength, knee-joint range of motion, and vertical jump performance were lessened. Furthermore, the administration of oat protein facilitated recovery from exhaustive downhill running in this study. These findings demonstrated that oat protein supplementation has the potential to alleviate the negative effects of eccentric exercise in untrained young males.",119,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,176
"There is evidence that oat beta-glucan lowers appetite and ad libitum eating; however, not all studies are consistent, and the underpinning mechanisms are not entirely understood. We investigated the effects of 4 g high molecular weight (MW) oat beta-glucan on ad libitwn eating, subjective appetite, glycemia, insulinemia and plasma GLP-1 responses in 33 normal-weight subjects (22 female/11 male, mean age (y): 26.9 +/- 1.0, BMI (kg/m(2)): 23.5 +/- 0.4). The study followed a randomised double-blind, cross-over design with subjects fed two test breakfasts with and without oat beta-glucan followed by an ad libitum test meal on two different days. Blood samples and ratings for subjective appetite were collected postprandially at regular time intervals. Oat beta-glucan increased feelings of fullness (p = 0.048) and satiety (p = 0.034), but did not affect energy and amount eaten at the ad libitum test meal. There was a treatment by time interaction for plasma GLP-1, plasma insulin and blood glucose.

"During the 20th century, the economic position of oats (Avena saliva L.) decreased strongly in favour of higher yielding crops including winter wheat and maize. Presently, oat represents only 1.3% of the total world grain production, and its production system is fragmented. Nonetheless, current interest is growing because of recent knowledge on its potential benefits in food, feed and agriculture. This perspective will serve as a further impetus, with special focus on the recently valued advantages of oats in human food and health. Five approved European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) health claims apply to oats. Four relate to the oat specific soluble fibres, the beta-glucans, and concern the maintenance and reduction of blood cholesterol, better blood glucose balance and increased faecal bulk. The fifth claim concerns the high content of unsaturated fatty acids, especially present in the endosperm, which reduces the risks of heart and vascular diseases. Furthermore, oat starch has a low glycemic index, which is favourable for weight control. Oat-specific polyphenols and avenanthramides have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, oats can contribute significantly to the presently recommended whole-grain diet. Next to globulins, oats contain a small fraction of prolamin storage proteins, called 'avenins', but at a much lower quantity than gluten proteins in wheat, barley and rye. Oat avenins do not contain any of the known coeliac disease epitopes from gluten of wheat, barley and rye. Long-term food studies confirm the safety of oats for coeliac disease patients and the positive health effects of oat products in a gluten-free diet. These effects are general and independent of oat varieties. In the EU (since 2009), the USA (since 2013) and Canada (since 2015) oat products may be sold as gluten-free provided that any gluten contamination level is below 20 ppm. Oats are, however, generally not gluten-free when produced in a conventional production chain, because of regular contamination with wheat, bar",121,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,311
"Avenanthramides (AVAs), unique phytochemicals in oat, have attracted an increasing amount of attention due to their outstanding health benefits. However, the chemical profile and the levels of AVAs in commercial oat products as well as their health benefits have not been examined in detail.

Among them, 17 novel AVA glucosides were reported in oat bran for the first time. The most abundant AVA glucoside, 2c-3'-O-glc, had a similar growth inhibitory activity with the major AVA, 2c, against HCT-116 and HT-29 human colon cancer cells, indicating glucosylation does not affect the growth inhibitory effects of AVAs.

"In the present study, oats were successively hydrolysed by cellulase and fermented with Monascus anka, and the phenolic profiles, antioxidant activities and enzyme inhibition activities of the soluble and insoluble phenolic fractions were investigated. The results revealed that the cellulase could release great quantities of insoluble phenolics from oats. Compared to the traditional fermentation system, the system of fermentation following enzymatic hydrolysis (FEH) further increased the soluble and insoluble phenolic contents (24.38% and 31.05%, respectively). The contents of gallic, chlorogenic and ferulic acid in the soluble fraction increased by 42.49%, 85.79% and 46.42%, respectively. Both soluble and insoluble phenolic fractions from the FEH system showed great DPPH and ABTS(+) radical scavenging abilities. Moreover, the soluble phenolic fraction exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher alpha-glucosidase inhibition, while the insoluble phenolic fraction had significantly (p < 0.05) higher alpha-amylase inhibitory activity.

"The aim of this work was to study the structure and functionalities of proteins from commercial oat milling fractions. Protein isolates obtained from fine (FB), medium (MB), and low (LB) oat brans, and whole oat groat flour (WF) contained 75.0-97.1% proteins. However, the protein content of the products of 15% (15% high glucan [15HG]) and 20% (20% high glucan [20HG]) HG flours were four fold less because of their high carbohydrate contents (similar to 75%). There was no apparent difference in molecular weights of the polypeptides (20, 35, 60, and 150kDa) contained in these protein products. Protein profiling using mass spectrometry showed that avenin was not detected in FB and MB because of their relatively high concentrations of 11-12S globulins. Secondary structural features of the molecules and microstructure details of the gelled proteins were similar for proteins from FB, MB, LB, and WF, but different from those of 15HG and 20HG. Similarly, these differences in the structural features of proteins of the milling fractions were reflected in their water-holding capacity and the solubility properties of the protein products.",125,99,0,99,0,0,0,0,3,2,178
"Oat bran is suggested to attenuate atherosclerotic conditions by regulating dyslipidemia, endothelial function, and oxidative damage. Through the measurement of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), oxidative stress, and inflammation status in liver and heart tissues of apolipoprotein E-/- (ApoE(-/-)), mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) or HFD with oat bran (HFD + Oat) were investigated. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), PUFA and over 40 types of its oxidized products were assessed. The HFD + Oat group had augmented adrenic acid (ADA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and suppressed n-3 docosapentaenoic acid levels in the liver tissues compared to the HFD group. Arachidonic acid (ARA) and -linolenic acid (ALA) levels were elevated and ADA was suppressed in the heart tissues of the HFD + Oat group compared to the HFD group. Furthermore, enzymatically mediated oxidized ARA product levels (9-, 11- and 20-HETE [hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid], and PGF(2)) were augmented and those of the oxidized DHA products (4-, 7-, 10-, 11-, 13-, and 14-HDHA [hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid]) were reduced in the liver tissues of the HFD + Oat group. It also increased 17-F-2t-dihomo-isoprostane and 7-F-2t-dihomo-isofuran derived from nonenzymatic oxidation of ADA in the heart and liver tissues, and those from ALA namely 16-F-1t-phytoprostane and 16(RS)-13-epi-ST14-9-phytofuran. Our study showed oat bran to be a weak antioxidant and lacked anti-inflammatory properties in atherosclerotic mice. Elevation of oxidized PUFA products that are potentially proinflammatory and vasoconstrictors (HETE, PGF(2)) with simultaneous reduction of those that are anti-inflammatory (HDHA) may not be desirable in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",126,-1,0,-1,0,1,1,2,2,0,254
"The protein concentrate was prepared from oat bran pre-treated with amyloglucosidase. The influence of amyloglucosidase on the efficiency of protein extraction and the functional properties of the resulting protein products were studied in comparison to the protein concentrate obtained by the conventional alkaline method. Samples, pre-treated with the enzyme, had a higher protein content (83.8%), control - 66.7%. Significant changes in the functionality of the protein product are associated with the hydrolysis of carbohydrates. Solubility, water retention and foaming capacity of product pre-treated with amyloglucosidase are higher. However, the oil-retaining capacity and stability of the foam of protein products of different methods of production did not possess a single trend.",127,1,-1,99,1,99,2,1,0,2,110
"Natural emulsifiers have become of increasing interest within the food and beverage industry. Oat bran is a natural side-stream product produced during oat refinement that may be used to obtain amphiphilic extracts. Our hypothesis was that the oat bran extract is rich in surface-active and amphiphilic oat saponins and proteins that can form and stabilize emulsions. For this, we examined the surface activity of oat bran extract at oil-water and air-water interfaces, its ability to form oil-in-water emulsions and their stability against various stress tests. The highly surface-active oat bran extract acted as an ionic emulsifier, forming highly negatively charged submicron-sized emulsion droplets. These emulsions were stable over a wide range of pH (4-9), heat treatment (>= 50 degrees C), and during storage at >= 2 degrees C up to 42 days. However, the emulsions showed instability at pH 2-3, at high ionic strengths, and during freeze-thawing. The formation and stability of the emulsions is related to interfaces containing oat saponins or oat saponin-protein complexes rather than a protein layer. These findings show that oat bran extract is a highly promising natural emulsifier, providing the food and beverage industry with a viable substitute to traditional emulsifiers.

"Oat bran was fermented by filamentous fungi to improve the extractability of beta-glucan. Box-Behnken experimental design and response surface methodology were used to obtain the maximum extractability of beta-glucan. Inoculum volume, fermentation temperature, and time were evaluated as three variables. Under optimal fermentation conditions, the extractability of beta-glucan in oat bran increased to 45.57 +/- 1.82% and 51.10 +/- 2.32% by Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae, respectively. The extractability was about 3-fold of that before fermentation (16.86 +/- 0.76%). Fermentation of oat bran by Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae reduced the molecular weight of the extracted beta-glucan from 6.74 x 10(5) to 2.84 x 10(5) and 2.20 x 10(5) Da, respectively. Correspondingly, the apparent viscosity of the extracted beta-glucan decreased after fermentation. But the increased extractability compensated for the reduced molecular weight in the formation of viscous solution. The molecular structure and cellotriosyl/cellotetraosyl ratio were not affected by filamentous fungi fermentation.",129,99,1,99,99,0,1,0,1,3,151
"Nowadays non-bread cereals, including oats, due to their healthy properties are increasingly used as additives in bread production. The aim of the present study was to evaluate new healthy triticale-oat bread by replacement as much as possible of triticale flour by high fibre oat concentrate (COF), without decreasing technological quality of bread. The flours obtained from 4 winter triticale varieties were enriched with 2.5%, 5% and 10% of COF. An increasing COF level resulted in significantly increased nutritional parameters content as well as dietary fibre (up to 11.5%), including six-fold increase in 13 glucan content (from 0.3% for control breads to 1.0% and 1.8% for 5% and 10% COF, respectively) and as a consequence even two-fold increase in viscosity of water extracts (WEV). Obtained results were compared to popular, available in bakery wheat and wheat-rye breads. All obtained triticale-oat breads can be included as food products high in fibre (over 6 g per 100 g). The dough properties and bread parameters, especially bread volume, shape and crumb texture decreased with the addition of COF. Results show that triticale flour replaced by up to 5% of COF makes it possible to prepare new kind of healthy bread. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",130,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,203
"Hypercholesterolemia is a major concern worldwide. The aim of this work was to evaluate the additive and synergistic effect of oat supplementation to probiotic fermented milk on lowering hypercholesterolemia in vivo. Forty eight male albino rats divided into six groups were fed with six different diets i.e. normal synthetic diet, cholesterol enriched diet, cholesterol enriched diet supplemented with skim milk, cholesterol enriched diet supplemented with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or (LGG) fermented skim milk at the rate of 10(8) cfu/ml, cholesterol enriched diet supplemented with oat bran and cholesterol enriched diet supplemented with oats in LGG fermented skim milk (10(8) cfu/ml) for 60 days. Blood samples were withdrawn on 0, 30 and 60 day to analyze the lipid profile. Hypocholesterolemic effect was illustrated in terms of lowering of cholesterol by 19%, triglycerides by 63.5%, LDL by 6%, VLDL by 44.5% in rats fed with oats supplemented with LGG. These values were not only higher than the values from other groups fed with either oats or LGG, but most importantly, the level of HDL did not increase significantly in this group.

"BACKGROUNDWhole oat and rice flours were mixed to develop instant flours by a high pressure and low mechanical shear extrusion process. The screw profile was designed aiming to obtain an infant food with gelatinized starch and high hydration ability. Response surface methodology was selected to study the impact of operating parameters such as temperature and screw speed (73-186 degrees C; 109-391rpm) on physicochemical and pasting properties of the final extruded product. The main challenge of this study was to process high oats content, since they are characterized by high lipid and fiber content, which impact on material processing. RESULTSThe optimal response was achieved at 170 degrees C and 350rpm. The optimal expansion ratio, bulk density, water absorption index, and water solubility index were 2.24, 289.65kg m(-3), 6.42g g(-1), and 4.75g g(-1) respectively. Overall, both temperature and screw speed affected the responses studied, except for water absorption index (only screw speed affected this response). Although lipids from oats reduce the expansion ratio of extrudates compared with samples containing higher starch proportions, their lipids protect the starch granules from mechanical degradation when higher screw speed values are used. As a result, both ungelatinized and gelatinized starches may be found in extrudates, which was confirmed by pasting property analyses. CONCLUSIONHigh oat content may be efficiently processed by optimizing the extruder conditions (temperature, screw speed, and profile), improving the nutritional properties of the final product.

"Oat bran protein flour (OBPF), containing protein, starch, and lipid as major constituents, was ball milled and subsequently evaluated on structural conformation, thermal properties, particle size distributions, and rheological properties. Prior to ball milling, characterisation of OBPF were conducted by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showing the existence of aggregated protein and starch-lipid complexes as predominant constituents of OBPF. Ball milling altered structural conformations of both protein and starch. Moreover, increase of ball milling time gradually decreased the transition enthalpy changes of amylose-lipid complexes upon heating which can be related to disruption of amylose-lipid complexes helical structure. Ball milling at higher speed resulted to smaller average particle size distributions of OBPF. Dynamic mechanical spectra of concentrated dispersions containing ball milled OBPF exhibited lower storage (G') and loss (G '') moduli compared to control sample due to reduced particles volume packing. Moduli-frequency sweep data satisfactory fitted the Power Law's model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",134,-1,0,1,1,99,2,1,1,1,163
"Avenanthramides are phenolic compounds found only in oats, and are of interest due to suggested bioactivities, including anti-inflammatory effects and induction of apoptosis. The objective of this work was to optimise a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for analysis of avenanthramides in food, and analyse the avenanthramide content in 45 oat fractions and products. The optimised HPLC method was based on triplicate extraction of 100 mg sample with 1 ml 80% ethanol in phosphate buffer (pH 2.8) and used gallacetophenone as an internal standard. Avenalumic acid-derived avenanthramide homologues 2f(d) and 2p(d) were also present, making up to 20% of the total avenanthramides detected in oats. The amounts of avenanthramides detected in oat products was 2-82 mu g/g.

"New technology makes it possible to apply organic fertilizers with higher precision, and organic producers want to know how to exploit these new possibilities to make their production more efficient. This study investigated the effect of band application (in different positions) of pelleted organic fertilizer, compared with broadcasting, on grain yield and weed density in spring oats (Avena sativa L.). Six microplot field experiments were carried out on silty clay and sandy loam in Sweden during the growing season of 2014-2016. In oats seeded at 25 cm row spacing, pelleted meat bone meal was band-applied at one of three distances from the crop row (0, 4, and 12.5 cm) and at two or three incorporation depths (1 and 4 cm on silty clay and 1, 4, and 6 cm on loamy sand). These treatments were compared with broadcast spreading, mineral nitrogen fertilizer, and an unfertilized control. On both soil types, fertilizer placement 4 cm from the crop and 4-6 cm incorporation depth gave the highest yield and crop nitrogen uptake. Yield in this treatment was 800 kg ha(-1) higher on clay soil and 1,100 kg ha(-1) higher on sandy loam compared with the same organic fertilizer applied by broadcasting, an 80-150% yield increase. On the sandy loam, distance from the crop row had a more significant effect on grain yield (p < 0.001) than soil incorporation depth (p = 0.07). On the silty clay, crop yield was significantly influenced by incorporation depth (p = 0.003) and distance from the crop row (p = 0.04). In five experiments, mineral N fertilizer equivalent (MFE) increased from on average 63% with broadcasting to 85% with placement 4 cm from the crop row and 4 cm incorporation depth. Weed biomass was significantly affected by fertilizer placement on the clay soil, with higher weed biomass with deeper incorporation (p = 0.045) and greater distance from the crop row (p = 0.049). On the sandy loam, there was a tendency for larger weed plants at greater distance from the crop row (p = 0.13) except when seeds and pellets were placed",136,99,-1,99,99,99,0,1,0,4,345
"Ochratoxin A (OTA) can cause toxicogenic effects in humans and animals when contaminated food products are consumed. Oat (Avena sativa), like any other cereal grain, can be contaminated with OTA when storage conditions are favorable for fungal growth and toxin production. South Dakota is among the leading oat-producing states in the United States. It is therefore important to determine the frequency of occurrence of the primary OTA-producing fungal species on oat grains produced in the state. In this study, we evaluated oat grain samples from South Dakota for the incidence of Penicillium verrucosum, the major ochratoxigenic fungus in temperate regions. Kernels from 12 oat cultivars grown at multiple locations in South Dakota from 2014 to 2016 (15 location-year combinations) were plated on dichloran yeast extract sucrose glycerol agar medium. P. verrucosum was detected on 0.30, 0.19, and 0.05% of the kernels tested in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. Overall, 22 of the 360 evaluated samples had kernels contaminated with P. verrucosum. The fungal incidence of the contaminated samples ranged from 1 to 16%, and the majority of those samples originated from one location.

"Dietary supplementation of oats has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and gastrointestinal disorders. The role of oat extract as prophylactic in treating acute liver injury is not thoroughly established. We, therefore, hypothesized that oat extract would exert protective effect against alcohol-induced acute liver injury in a mouse model. To test this hypothesis, male C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with phenolic-enriched ethyl acetate (EA) fraction of oats (prepared by fractionating aqueous ethanolic extract with solvents of increasing polarity) at dosages of 125 and 250 mg kg(-1)d(-1) for 12 consecutive days. Acute liver injury was induced by administering 5 doses of 50% ethanol intragastrically (10 g/kg body weight) to mice at an interval of 12 hours. The alcohol-induced liver injury was evaluated by measuring serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, antioxidant parameters, mitochondrial function, and histology of liver tissue. Our results demonstrated that pretreatment with EA fraction at 250 mg kg(-1)d(-1) significantly (P < .001 for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and thiobarbituric add-reactive species and P < .01 for lactate dehydrogenase and nitrites) reduced the levels of liver injury markers and significantly (P < .001 for glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase; P < .01 for catalase, superoxide dismustase, and vitamin C; P < .05 for reduced glutathione and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1) increased the levels of antioxidant defenses. Furthermore, EA-pretreated mice showed mechanistic inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway through decreased phosphorylation and degradation of I kappa B alpha. We conclude that phenolic-enriched EA fraction of oats has immense potential to serve as dietary intervention against alcohol-induced liver damage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

"This study comprises laboratory-scale extraction of soluble beta-glucan (BG) from oat (16 and 32% BG) and barley (12 and 32% BG) fractions, investigation of chemical composition and stability of dispersions prepared from water extracts and techno-economic evaluation for small industrial scale production. Oat and barley fractions were hydrolysed with an enzyme preparation and BG was extracted from hydrolysed samples by boiling water. Enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in medium molecular weight (MW = 38,500 -69,400 g/mol) after 2 h incubation with 10 nkat beta-glucanase activity/g bran and low MW (11,800 -22,600 g/mol) after 4 h incubation with 50 nkat/g bran. MW and concentration of BG affected the stability of dispersions during storage. Barley fractions, after both 2 and 4 h hydrolysis, resulted in higher viscosities than oat fractions. MW of BG in soluble barley fractions was only slightly higher, but the difference in MW does not seem to be adequate to justify the observed viscosity differences. Barley extracts contained higher amounts of starch, however, starch did not have a distinct effect on viscosity. Techno-economic analysis for production process with feedstock design capacity of 100 kg/h showed that production costs varied from 0.06 to 0.11 (SIC)/g soluble BG.

"An increase in the number of foodborne outbreaks and recalls due to Salmonella in low-moisture foods has resulted in the need for the development and validation of process controls to ensure their microbiological safety. Furthermore, the Food Safety Modernization Act Preventive Controls for Human Food final rule requires fixed processors to validate their process controls to ensure food safety. The objective of this study was to develop a response surface model to predict Salmonella inactivation in oat flour, as affected by moisture, fat content, screw speed, and temperature. Oat flour was adjusted to different moisture (14 to 26% wet basis) and fat (5 to 15% [w/w]) contents and was then inoculated with a five-strain cocktail of Salmonella. Inoculated material was extruded through a single-screw extruder running at different screw speeds (75 to 225 rpm) and temperatures (65 to 85 degrees C), without a die. Once steady-state conditions were attained, extruded samples were collected, cooled, and stored under refrigeration, and Salmonella survivors were enumerated. A split-plot central composite second-order response surface design was used, with the central point replicated six times. Temperature showed a significant (P < 0.0005) positive effect on microbial reduction. Moisture content showed significant linear (P = 0.0014) and quadratic (P = 0.0005) effects, whereas higher fat content showed a significant (P < 0.0001) protective effect on Salmonella destruction. The screw speed did not play a major role in inactivating Salmonella, but it had a significant (P=0.0004) interactive effect with temperature. Results indicated that a >5.5-log reduction was achieved in oat flour extruded at a temperature above 85 degrees C at all moisture and fat contents evaluated at a screw speed of 150 rpm.

"Viscosity generated by oat beta-glucan induces gastrointestinal mechanisms that influence appetite. Two oat-based ready-to-eat cereals (RTEC) with similar amounts of beta-glucan but differing in their protein and sugar content were compared for their effects on appetite. Forty-seven healthy individuals, >= 18 years old, enrolled in a crossover trial consumed RTEC 1 or RTEC 2 in random order at least a week apart. Breakfasts contained 250kcals cereal and 105kcals fat free milk. Subjective ratings of appetite were completed at baseline, and at 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after consumption of the breakfast meals.

More-over, the increasing granule size, less gaps and more contact points can be observed in the microstructure of starch-protein network with high moisture. Meanwhile, high moisture content also resulted in that fractal parameter of oat section increased from 2.6891 to 2.8001 significantly.

"In compliance with Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA received from the European Commission a mandate to provide its reasoned opinion on the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for acetamiprid which might lead to consumers intake concerns on the basis of the new toxicological reference values agreed upon by Member States (MSs) in October 2017. In order to identify the MRLs of potential concern that require a more detailed assessment, EFSA performed a preliminary risk assessment, identifying a risk for consumers for 12 commodities. Measures for reduction of the consumer exposure were assessed by EFSA and should be considered by risk managers. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, ADAMA Makhteshim Ltd submitted two requests to modify the existing MRL for acetamiprid in table olives, olives for oil production, barley and oats. The data submitted in support of the requests were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all crops under assessment.

Substitution of oat starch with milk components increased hot paste stability and reduced peak viscosity using the RVA method of assessment. Furthermore, thermal processing affected the granules size, swelling power and flow behaviour of the mixtures containing oat starch in combination with different dairy ingredients. Oat starch illustrated reduced swelling and breakdown properties when pasted in the presence of WPC and SMP.

"This work aims to investigate the effects of carbohydrate-hydrolysing enzymes on the release of phenolics in oat fermentation with Monascus anka. There were good correlations between phenolic content and a-amylase, xylanase and FPase activities. A high level of alpha-amylase activity (141.07 U/g) was observed, while xylanase (2.40 U/g), total cellulase (0.52 U/g) and beta-glucosidase activities (0.028 U/g) were relatively low in the fermentation system. The phenolic content of oat powder treated with crude enzyme from fermented oats significantly increased, especially that of the ferulic acid in the insoluble fraction and the vanillic acid in the soluble fraction. The surface SEM morphology of the oats showed that the cell wall structure was damaged by the crude enzyme treatment, which led to the release of phenolics.

"Celiac disease is triggered by the ingestion of gluten from wheat, barley, rye, and possibly oats. Gluten is quantitated by DNA-based methods or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). ELISAs mostly detect the prolamin fraction and potentially over- or underestimate gluten contents. Therefore, a new independent method is required to comprehensively detect gluten. A targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to quantitate seven barley, seven rye, and three oat marker peptides derived from each gluten protein fraction (prolamin and glutelin) and type (barley, B-, C-, D-, and gamma-hordeins; rye, gamma-75k-, gamma-40k-, omega-, and HMW-secalins). The quantitation of each marker peptide in the chymotryptic digest of a defined amount of the respective reference gluten protein type resulted in peptide specific yields, which enabled the conversion of peptide into protein concentrations. This method was applied to quantitate gluten in samples from the brewing process, in raw materials for sourdough fermentation, and in dried sourdoughs.",148,99,1,-1,0,99,1,1,1,2,153
"Vegetation indices are widely used to indicate the nutritional status of crops, as well as to estimate their harvest yield. However, their accuracy is influenced by the phenological stage of evaluation and the index used. The present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Inverse Ratio Vegetation Index (IRVI) in the prediction of grain yield and biomass of white oat cultivated under irrigation levels, besides indicating the best phenological stage for evaluation. The irrigation levels consisted of 11 %, 31 %, 60 %, 87 % and 100 % of the maximum evapotranspiration, with four replicates. The mean values for NDVI and IRVI were determined using an active terrestrial sensor, at four phenological stages (4, 8, 10 and 10.5.4). The white oat grain yield and biomass may be estimated with a high precision using the NDVI and IRVI. The NDVI was more accurate than the IRVI. The grain yield estimate was more accurate from the flag leaf sheath appearance stage (10), whereas, for the biomass, the best estimate was for the kernel watery ripe stage (10.5.4).",149,99,0,99,1,99,1,0,1,3,182
"Oat (Avena sativa L.) is an underutilized cereal and is considered as a rich source of protein, minerals, lipids, beta-glucan and other phytochemicals. It has an immense scope for its application in preparation of various nutraceutical and functional foods. Oat flour was incorporated with wheat flour at different concentrations for preparation of breads and noodles. Breads were prepared by incorporation of oat flour (OF) in wheat flour (WF) at different levels (0, 10, 15, 20 and 25%). Overall acceptability of breads decreased with increase in level of oat flour. However, breads were moderately desirable up to 20% replacement of WF with OF and slightly desirable at 25% level of replacement. Significant decrease in loaf volume of oat incorporated bread (OIB) was observed with increase in level of incorporation of OF in WF. Oat incorporated noodles (OIN) were prepared by substitution of OF in WF at proportion of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40%. These were moderately desirable only up to 30% replacement of wheat flour with oat flour and slightly desirable thereafter. There was significant (P=0.05) increase in proteins, crude fibres, ash and fat content but significant decrease in carbohydrate content and calorific value of processed products was recorded with increased incorporation of OF in WF. Results of organoleptic evaluation concluded that bread and noodles were moderately desirable up to 20 and 30% replacement of wheat flour with oat flour, respectively. Therefore, oat can be successfully substituted with wheat flour upto a level of 20% for bread and 30% for noodle preparation thereby, enhancing the nutritional components such as crude protein, fibre, fat and ash content in prepared products.",150,-1,1,0,1,1,3,1,1,0,269
"A plethora of studies have shown that the physicochemical properties of oat beta-glucan determine its health benefits. However, the impact of the passage through the gastrointestinal tract on the conformational and structural characteristics is not fully understood. The present study aims to elucidate the structure and conformation of gently extracted oat beta-glucan before and after in vitro gastric and gastrointestinal digestion utilizing asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) and NMR spectroscopy. The structural features and the bile acid-binding capacity of oat beta-glucan were probed with NMR. Oat beta-glucan without digestion presented primary aggregates with fringed micelle structure, and other high molar mass supramolecular secondary aggregates were detected. Under gastric conditions, the molar mass was reduced and an increase in apparent density, suggesting more compact and disrupted aggregates, was observed. In the intestinal phase, the conformation was restored as prior digestion. No effect of the digestive enzymes on the conformation of oat beta-glucan was shown, except from a modest effect of pepsin under gastric conditions. In contrast, the bile acids induced alterations to the apparent density of the oat beta-glucan aggregates indicating a molecular interaction which was further confirmed with NMR by observing numerous changes in the resonance of bile acids' carbons in presence of oat beta- glucan. In conclusion, the examination of oat beta-glucan under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions with AF4 and NMR sheds light on the aggregation behavior and interaction mechanisms and enables a rich gain of knowledge for its physiological effects.

"In this research, the influence of ultrasonic application and temperature on extraction yields of free, esterified, bound phenolics, and beta-glucan from defatted oat bran was investigated. Ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) and conventional extraction (CE) were performed at different temperature. Extracts kinetics were monitored by determining the total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity (ORAC), and total avenanthramides of free phenolic compounds by mathematical model. HPLC-DAD was used to identify and quantify the main phenolic compounds. The results suggested that phenolic extraction yields of UAE was faster and higher than that of CE for free phenolics, with fitting to mathematically model (MRPD < 6%) well, whereas the bound fractions decreased. Besides, the TPC, ORAC and total avenanthramides of free phenolics were significantly improved by increasing the temperature in both UAE and CE, whereas the bound were significantly decreased. beta-Glucan yields pretreated in UAE were approximately 37% higher than that in CE.

"This study explored a novel strategy to develop solid-state whole-grain oats as a novel carrier of lactic acid bacteria and a nutraceutical supplement rich in ACE inhibitory peptides. Oats were fermented by Lactobacillus plantarum B1-6, Rhizopus oryzae, or a combination of L. plantarum B1-6 and R. oryzae. L. plantarum showed a much better growth performance in oats when it was combined with R. oryzae than when it was cultured alone, as evidenced by an increase in viable cell count to 9.70 log cfu g(-1) after 72 h of fermentation. The coinoculated fermented oats (CFO) and the R. oryzae-fermented oats (RFO) were then selected for investigations on protein hydrolysis and on the functional properties of the released bioactive peptides. The results showed that the soluble protein contents changed from 7.05 mg g(-1) to 14.43 and 10.21 mg g(-1) for CFO and RFO, respectively. However, the degree of hydrolysis and the content of peptides with molecular masses less than 10 000 Da indicated that the CFO proteins can be degraded to a greater degree. As analyzed by electrophoresis and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, the protein and peptide profiles of CFO and RFO demonstrated that the proteins from CFO were more obviously hydrolyzed and more small peptides were obtained. In addition, both CFO and RFO presented higher ACE inhibitory activities than unfermented oats, whereas the protein extracts from CFO exerted a lower IC50 value of 0.42 mg protein per mL compared with the protein extracts from the other samples. This research has broadened our knowledge on the development of whole-grain oat products as a probiotic carrier and on the difference between mixed solid-state fermentation (SSF) and fungi SSF in terms of protein degradation and the capacity to release ACE inhibitory peptides. Our approach could be used to obtain probiotic food products and probably to develop oats as a potential therapeutic ingredient targeting hypertension.",153,1,0,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,310
"This article explores oat's polyphenols extraction in ethanol/water and methanol/water at a nonthermal pilot scale. Alcohol % (vol/vol) and cycles were controlled by response surface methodology. Eight polyphenols were evaluated (HPLC), together with antioxidant capacity (ORAC) and total polyphenol content (TPC). Model adjusted well in the majority of the cases. Highest TPC and ORAC were obtained with ethanolic mixtures. Vanillic acid and vanillin highest yields were at 14.6% (vol/vol) and 50% (vol/vol) in both alcohols. Hydrocinnamic acids were better extracted at high alcohol concentrations (98-100%, vol/vol), where p-coumaric acid was the most present. Avenanthramides optimum alcohol extraction composition varied from 50 to 100% (vol/vol). Hence, different polarity behavior was observed (2c>2f>2p). Avenanthramide 2c showed the highest yield. Cycles effect varied depending on the polyphenol evaluated, they were more necessary for the extraction of p-coumaric acid and avenanthramide 2f. Results aid to understand solvation process for a more efficient polyphenols extraction. Practical applicationsThe research fills the gap between reported laboratory work and the lack of experimental scale up data. It considers scale up aspects such as developing a simple and easy to scale process (ambient temperature and 8bars pressure) and using food grade solvents. Extractions were run with a controlled particle size distribution rather than a specific particle size. A small solvent/solid ratio was kept, since excessive amount of solvent generates expensive downstream operations. Moreover, solvent was reused on each run until the necessary cycles were completed. The optimization here presented will allow a better understanding in the extraction of oat's polyphenols; individually, as group, and total. This will aid for a more robust polyphenols extractions from oat at the food industry.",154,99,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,5,271
"The physicochemical properties of the oat beta-glucan powder (BG) and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)-loaded BG powder (L-BG) produced by the pressurized gas-expanded liquid (PGX) technology were studied. Helium ion microscope, differential scanning calorimeter, X-ray diffractometer, AutoSorb iQ and rheometer were used to determine the particle morphology, thermal properties, crystallinity, surface area and viscosity, respectively. Both BG (7.7 mu m) and L-BG (6.1 mu m) were produced as micrometer-scale particles, while CoQ10 nanoparticles (92 nm) were adsorbed on the porous structure of L-BG. CoQ10 was successfully loaded onto BG using the PGX process via adsorptive precipitation mainly in its amorphous form. Viscosity of BG and L-BG solutions (0.15%, 0.2%, 0.3% w/v) displayed Newtonian behavior with increasing shear rate but decreased with temperature. Detailed characterization of the physicochemical properties of combination ingredients like L-BG will lead to the development of novel functional food and natural health product applications.",155,1,99,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,145
"Starch and beta-glucan are most abundant carbohydrate polymers available in oat products; however, their simultaneous release during extraction depends on morphological and processing conditions of raw material. The study analyzes the mutual correlation between the sample (oat flakes and bran) and treatment types (microwave heating (MW)-1-5 min; conventional heating (CH)-7 min) on water extract properties focusing on beta-glucan, starch, and glucose content as well as the antioxidant activity of water extracts. The strong negative partial coefficient correlation was found between solids-starch (- 0.65) and starch-glucose (- 0.89) content as well as DPPH (- 0.66) antioxidant activity in oat flakes revealing the high release of glucose to the water phase and its prooxidant activity. For the oat bran, positive and very high partial coefficient was found for both glucose (0.98) and beta-glucan (0.98) content in solids while the mutual interaction between them was highly negative (- 0.97), meaning the more beta-glucan, the less glucose in the water phase.",156,1,1,0,1,99,3,0,1,1,157
"Increased digesta viscosity is considered the mechanism underlying the cholesterol-lowering effect of oat beta-glucan. Viscosity is mainly related to the molecular weight and concentration of solubilized beta-glucan in the digesta and these should therefore be maintained at sufficiently high levels. Bread that includes oat bran is a potential source of beta-glucan, but the baking process leads to degradation by beta-glucanases present in the flours. In the current study, we investigated the effect of fermentation time as well as of particle size and content of oat bran in breads on the molecular weight, solubility and extract viscosity of beta-glucan. Furthermore, we estimated the potential of the breads to have a cholesterol-lowering effect by comparison of molecular weight, solubility and extract viscosity of beta-glucan with those of products known to have an effect in vivo. Longer fermentation time and smaller particles were found to lead to lower molecular weight of beta-glucan. However, smaller particles also increased its extractability, leading to an overall increase in extract viscosities compared with coarse particles. Bread with the inclusion of 30% finely-milled, but not coarse oat bran was found to induce extract viscosity with the potential of producing a cholesterol-lowering effect despite more degraded beta-glucan.

"The purpose of this work was to better understand the interactions between oat protein (OPI) and shellac to form oat protein-shellac based gels at near neutral pH as carrier to protect and deliver sensitive bioactive compounds. There were moderate interactions between OPI and shellac with a binding constant (K-a) of 2.088 x 10(3) M-1 via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding as revealed by Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (ITC) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Such interactions allowed the formation of a gel-like mixture with good compatibility that only one endothermic peak and T-g value for OPI-shellac mixture as demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Novel core (OPI)-shell (OPI-shellac mixture) beads were then developed by a cold-gelation method at near neural pH and ambient temperature. The optimized samples possessed a homogeneous, smooth and integrated shell structure. This structure could effectively restrict the swelling of the shell and prevent premature diffusion of the contained riboflavin. Also, this structure could efficiently protect the survival of L. acidophilus as 85.5% and the activity of amylase as 80.0% in the harsh environment of simulated gastric fluids after 1 h. When transferred to a simulated intestinal tract, riboflavin and L. acidophilus were sustainably released. Since the beads are easily prepared using a simple extrusion method at near neutral pH and ambient temperature, they are excellent candidates for natural delivery systems for sensitive bioactive compounds in the food and biomedical industries.

"BACKGROUNDNowadays there is a growing demand for nutritionally balanced breakfast beverages enriched with functional ingredients including wholegrain oat, which is rich in phenolic acids. Such beverages typically contain added food ingredients (e.g. milk protein, sugar and lipids) and undergo thermal processing that initiates many molecular processes. Therefore, this work aims to investigate the molecular interactions between milk protein and phenolic acids that govern bioactivity in model oat-based beverages. RESULTSFindings showed the susceptibility of ferulic and p-coumaric acids, in model oat beverages, to ultra-high temperature (UHT) processing at 145 degrees C for 8 s. Among model beverages, those with added milk protein demonstrated a considerable loss of phenolic acids following UHT processing due to the interaction between these micronutrients and the protein. The nature of molecular interactions was mainly categorized as covalent with hydrogen bonds playing a supportive role. CONCLUSIONUHT processing of oat-based beverage formulations facilitates the formation of protein-phenolic acid complexes, which are largely covalent and static in nature. This finding underlines the ability of UHT treatment to induce chemical modifications of food ingredients. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",159,1,99,-1,1,0,2,1,1,1,180
"Finland is the second largest oat producer in Europe. Despite the existing knowledge of phenolics in oat, there is little information on the phenolic composition of oats from Finland. The aim of the study was to investigate the concentrations of free and bound phenolic acids, as well as avenanthramides in eight Finnish cultivars of husked oat (Avena sativa L.). Seven phenolic acids and one phenolic aldehyde were identified, including, in decreasing order of abundance: p-coumaric, ferulic, cinnamic, syringic, vanillic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, and omicron-coumaric acids and syringaldehyde. Phenolic acids were mostly found as bound compounds. Significant varietal differences (p < 0.05) were observed in the cumulative content of phenolic acids, with the lowest level found in cv. 'Viviana' (1202 +/- 52.9 mg kg(-1)) and the highest in cv. 'Akseli' (1687 +/- 80.2 mg kg(-1)). Avenanthramides (AVNs) 2a, 2p, and 2f were the most abundant.

"Oat beta-glucan-amino acid/peptide conjugates were prepared through Maillard reaction between oat bglucan and amino acid/peptide. FT-IR, high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), and rheometry were used to characterize the structural and rheological properties of the amino acid/peptide conjugates. The results showed that the amino acid and peptide were successfully bonded with oat bglucan to give beta-glucan-amino acid conjugates and beta-glucan peptide conjugates, respectively. The 2% (w/v) solution of beta-glucan-amino acid conjugates showed shear thinning behavior as non-Newtonian fluid over the entire measured shear rates at 25 degrees C. The apparent viscosity of beta-glucan-amino acid conjugates was increased compared with that of oat beta-glucan. On the contrary, the viscosity of beta-glucan peptide conjugates decreased sharply and showed a Newtonian fluid when shear rate was higher than 10 s(-1). The storage modulus (G') of beta-glucan-amino acid conjugates was much higher than that of beta-glucan and bglucan peptide conjugates at the frequency of 1 Hz. The G' was higher than the loss modulus (G'') at all frequencies for all the oat beta-glucan conjugates solutions at 7% (w/v) concentration, indicating that both of beta-glucan-amino acid conjugates and b-glucan peptide conjugates presented as a solid-like behavior.

"Reducing the glycaemic response to carbohydrate-containing foods may have desirable physiological effects for many people. Here, we aimed to determine the minimum amount of oat p-glucan from oat bran which, when added to instant-oatmeal, would reduce the glycaemic response by 20% compared to a ii-glucan-free cereal. Therefore, the glycaemic responses elicited by one serving (27 g) instant-oatmeal plus 247 g 2% milk (10, 28 g available-carbohydrate, 1.2 g (i-glucan) or 10 plus 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 or 1.6 g oat p-glucan (OBG) from oat-bran, or an available-carbohydrate matched portion of cream of rice (CR) plus milk were measured over 2 h in n = 40 subjects using a randomized, cross-over design. The primary endpoint was incremental area under the curve (iAUC). The secondary endpoint was glucose peak-rise. The results showed that grams OBG consumed were significantly correlated with mean iAUC (p = 0.009) and with mean glucose peak-rise (p = 0.002). Each gram of OBG reduced iAUC by 7% and peak-rise by 15%. Thus, to achieve a >20% reduction in iAUC relative to CR, 1.6 g OBG had to be added to 10 (74 +/- 7 vs. 93 +/- 6 mmol min L-1, p < 0.05), but, to achieve a 20% reduction in peak-rise, only 0.4 g OBG was required (2.00 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.40 +/- 0.1 mmol, p < 0.05). We conclude that adding OBG to 10 flattened postprandial glycaemic responses in a dose-dependent fashion; 1.6 g OBG was required to reduce iAUC by >20% versus CR, but a 20% reduction in peak-rise required only 0.4 g. The greater effect of OGB on peak-rise than iAUC presumably reflects the way viscous dietary fibres modulate glucose absorption kinetics.",162,1,1,0,1,99,3,0,1,1,277
"Oat bran is widely used for enrichment of health-oriented products due to their high dietary fiber (DF) and bioactive compounds contents. However, its high phytic acid (PA) content generally is overlooked. PA is an antinutrient which decreases bioavailability of minerals and proteins. Therefore, our aim was to produce oat bran cookies with low PA content. Oat bran was dephytinized with two different methods (fermentation and hydrothermal). Cookies were prepared by substitution of flour with dephytinized oat brans (0%, 7%, 14% and 21%) and evaluated in terms of physical characteristics, functional and sensory properties. Dephytinized oat brans supplemented cookies had significantly low PA content. Additionally, this supplementation enhanced DF content, phenolic compounds content and antioxidant activity of corresponding cookies much more than untreated bran. Oat bran and dephytinized oat bran addition has similar effects on cookies, resulted in higher spread ratios, harder texture and darker color. Their sensory evaluation scores are promising, especially fermented oat bran's.

"This research explores the effects of pressure and temperature on the supercritical extraction of poly-phenols, antioxidant capacity, and total polyphenolic content from oats. Ethanol (80% v/v) was used as co-solvent, and experiments were controlled by response surface methodology (RSM). For polyphenols with C6-C1 structures (vanillin and vanillic acid), a maximum yield of 18.2 mu g/g oats was obtained. Polyphenols with C6-C3 structures (caffeic, sinapic, coumaric, and ferulic acids) gave up to 1389 mu g/g oats; where coumaric and ferulic acids were found in higher quantities. Avenanthramides (AVNs) yielded up to 34.52 mu g/g oats, with 2p and 2c being found in higher quantities than 2f. The polyphenols, TPC (1.25 mg GAE/g of oats), and ORAC (117.88 mu mol TE/g of oats) gave the highest yields at 38 MPa and 55 degrees C. Quadratic models adjusted very well, and a maximum polyphenol content of 1437.57 mu g/g was predicted. Moreover, correlations among the polyphenols and antioxidant capacity were found, especially with the ORAC.

"This study clarified the effects of well-characterized oat globulin peptides on antidiabetic drug targets (dipeptidyl peptidase IV [DPP4], alpha-glucosidase, glucose transporters 2 and 5 [GLUT2, GLUT5]) in Caco-2 cells. Twenty-two peptides with over 8 residues were identified from the tryptic hydrolysates (OGb, MM < 3 kDa) of oat globulin using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Computational docking demonstrated that LQAFEPLR (-8.8 kcal/mol) and EFLLAGNNK (-9.1 kcal/mol) effectively inactivated DPP4 binding to its active sites with low interaction energy. OGb, LQAFEPLR and EFLLAGNNK potently inhibited DPP4 and alpha-glucosidase activity in vitro concentration-dependently. Additionally, OGb (IC50, 188.1 mu g/mL) and LQAFEPLR (141.7 mu M) concentration-dependently inhibited DPP4 activity in Caco-2 cells. Specifically, they significantly downregulated the expression of DPP4 protein in Caco-2 cells (p <.05). However, these oat peptides also upregulated the expressions of alpha-glucosidase, GLUT2 and GLUTS proteins in the cells.

"This study aimed to explore the dynamic changes in the antioxidant activities and phenolic acid profiles of oat and buckwheat vinegars during different production stages. The results showed that both oat and buckwheat vinegar products comparably attenuated D-galactose-induced oxidative damage in mice serum and liver, indicating no obvious dose dependence within the tested concentrations. However, oat vinegar product revealed more favorable in vitro antioxidant activities than those in buckwheat vinegar product as evaluated by 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging abilities. Moreover, the alcoholic fermentation, acetic acid fermentation and fumigating induced successive increase in DPPH radical scavenging abilities and phenolic acid contents of the fermentation substrates of oat and buckwheat vinegars. Importantly, the different fermentation processes of oat and buckwheat vinegars were accompanied by the dynamic migration and transformation of specific phenolic acids across bound, esterified and free fractions.

The addition of oat level above 15% increased the extrudate protein availability and water absorption capacity. DT greater than 110 degrees C and feed moistures greater than 14% results in a steep increase in expansion ratio.

"Background & objective: Animal studies report that oat (Avena sativa L) intake has favorable effects on kidney function. However, the effects of oat consumption have not been assessed in humans. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of oat intake on biomarkers of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: Fifty-two patients with CKD were randomly assigned to a control group (recommended to reduce intake of dietary protein, phosphorus, sodium and potassium) or an oat consumption group (given nutritional recommendations for controls +50 g/day oats). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), urine creatinine, serum albumin, serum potassium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum klotho and urine protein concentration were measured at baseline and after an eight-week intervention. Creatinine clearance was calculated using urine creatinine concentration. Results: Within group analysis showed a significant increase in BUN (P = 0.02) and serum potassium (P = 0.01) and a marginally significant increment in SCr (P = 0.08) among controls. However, changes in the oat group were not significant. In a multivariate adjusted model, we observed a significant difference in change of serum potassium (-0.03 mEq/L for oat group and 0.13 mEq/L for control group; P = 0.01) and a marginally significant difference in change of serum albumin (0.01 g/d1 for oat group and 0.08 for control group; P = 0.08) between the two groups.

The effects of CSB flour fortification with oat beta-glucan (O beta G, 1-5% of wheat flour) on the rheological properties of dough and specific volume, texture and stalling characteristics of CSB have been examined The addition of oat beta-glucan to the dough formula increased the farinograph water absorption, dough development time and the resistance to deformation but decreased the dough stability, dough weakening degree, extensibility, peak, hold final and setback viscosity and retrogradation value; CSB with 1-2% O beta G addition possessed the higher specific volume and resilience and showed the similar hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess and chewiness compared to the control; while, CSB with 4-5% O beta G addition exhibited a smaller specific volume, a larger hardness and the similar springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness and resilience than did the contra O beta G addition resulted in the higher freezable and unfreezable water content and in the lower firmness and amylopectin retrogradation during storage at 25 degrees C, thus retarded CSB staling. The results also revealed that O beta G at 1-2% addition levels was more effective in helping to soften CSB and preventing CSB staling and did at 4-5% addition.",172,1,0,99,99,99,1,0,1,3,207
"To evaluate the lowering-lipid effect of oat beta-glucan (O beta G) and its molecular mechanism, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperlipidemic mouse model and oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation model of HepG2 cells were used in this study. O beta G obviously reduced HFD-induced the gain of body weight and epididymal fat pad, and inhibited hepatic adipocyte hyperplasia. These effects were associated with the down-regulation of FAS and SREBP-1, up-regulation of PPAR alpha and particularly the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in both liver and fat tissues. In the oleic acid-induced HepG2 cells, O beta G partly suppressed lipogenesis and activated AMPK. O beta G inhibited lipid metabolism-related protein expressions such as FAS, SREBP-1, CPT-1, PPAR alpha and activating ACC, which are the downstream targets of AMPK. Taken together, our results suggest that administration of O beta G exerts lipid-lowering effect in HFD mice via AMPK signal pathway, which provide novel application for the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia.",173,1,-1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,158
"Minimally processed cereal breakfast products from whole grain entered the market due to consumer demand of more nutritional food with more controlled sugar release. However, the subsequent processing of such products with different cooking methods in the consumer's kitchen may lead to significant differentiation of their nutritional value. Therefore, the evaluation of the impact of frequently used cooking methods on a final quality of breakfast cereals meal is needed. The present study investigates how the two different methods of heating, conventional and microwave (MW) assisted, affect the carbohydrate content, profile and resulting glycemic index of so prepared food as well as the antioxidant activity of meals. Two products available on the marketoat bran and flakeswere used. The highest starch content in fluid phase of oatmeal was detected in samples heated for 3 min with microwaves, regardless the type. The lowest starch content was obtained for 5 min MW heated flakes sample. The total content of glucose was about 1.5 times lower in bran vs. flakes oatmeal. The highest -glucan content in fluid fraction was also observed for bran meal but its release was independent of applied conditions.",174,1,0,99,99,-1,1,1,1,2,187
"Breaking force, deformation, breaking energy, strength, hardness and rigidity of oat kernel under different loading rates (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.10 mm/s) and loading position (ventral and dorsal sides) were determined within a moisture content range of 15.7%-27.5% (w.b.) by using a texture analyzer (TA) to investigate mechanical properties for shearing breakage of oat kernel. Complete randomized design was experimented to construct the force-distance curve. In this study, these mechanical properties of oat kernel were expressed as a function of moisture content and loading rate respectively. The result showed that breaking force, energy, strength, hardness and rigidity decreased linearly with the increasing moisture content and increased firstly and decreased then with the increasing loading rate. Deformation had an increasing trend with the increase in moisture content and loading rate. The highest values of breaking force, breaking energy, strength, hardness and rigidity were obtained at 0.08 mm/s loading rate. Moreover the dorsal side of oat kernel had a better shearing capacity compared with ventral side, which reflected in that breaking force, strength and hardness were great significantly at 95% confident level when dorsal side was loaded.",175,99,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,5,186
"The main purpose of the current study was to assess the physicochemical properties of the synbiotic yogurt fermented with oat slurry and probiotic strains and the antioxidative and antibacterial activities of the oat-based synbiotic yogurt. The viable cells of Lactobacillus brevis SBP49 and Lactobacillus acidophilus SBP55 reached 10(8) CFU/g or more in the probiotic and oat-based synbiotic yogurt, and the resistance to artificial digestive juices and the adherence to intestinal epithelial cells of these lactic acid bacteria were also very high in these yogurts. In addition, oat flour added for the manufacture of the synbiotic yogurt significantly promoted the production of antimicrobial substances by these probiotics, thereby increasing the antibacterial effect of the strains against pathogenic food poisoning bacteria including Bacillus cereus American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 11778, Escherichia coli O157 ATCC 43889, Listeria monocytogenes Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) 3569, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Salmonella typhimurium KCTC 2514, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Meanwhile, the antioxidative activity of the oat-based synbiotic yogurt was significantly higher than that of the probiotic yogurt and its activity may be due to free radical scavenging ability of phenolic compounds contained in oat slurry.",176,1,99,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,191
"Electrospun synthetic fiber was used to reinforce protein-based composite. Two monolayer and laminated films based on either made from just isolated oat protein or a composite containing an interlayer of nylon-6 nanofiber was developed. It was revealed that monolayer film has relatively weak barrier and mechanical properties compared to other proteinous films. To improve film characteristics, 0.5, 1, and 1.5% (wt/wt) of the nanofiber were incorporated into the film. According to the results, film solubility in water decreased while its oxygen and water vapor permeability and mechanical properties were significantly improved. Due to the presence of 1.5% (wt/wt) of nanofiber, the elastic modulus increased significantly and, therefore, glass transition temperature (TG) of laminated film was also increased. Addition of nanofibers did not significantly affect optical properties. The results show that incorporation of electrospun nylon nanofibers into a film obtained from a natural polymer may show promise and improves its properties. Practical applicationsLaminating of different films and combination of their features are one of the popular methods to improve properties of biodegradable films. In this study, electrospun nylon nanofiber was incorporated as interlayer of film based on oat protein. By this way, effect of interlayer nylon nanofiber mat (NNM) on physical and mechanical properties of oat protein-NNM was investigated. The results showed that water vapor and oxygen permeability, mechanical properties, and its resistance to soluble in water improved, while interlayer did not have significant effect on optical properties of laminated film.",177,1,99,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,240
"BACKGROUNDCommon beans have been associated with anti-diabetic effects, due to its high content of bioactive compounds. Nevertheless, its consumption has decreased worldwide. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the development of novel functional foods elaborated with common beans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-diabetic effect of oat-bean flour cookies, and to analyze its bioactive composition, using commercial oat-wheat cookies for comparative purposes. RESULTSOat-bean cookies (1.2g kg(-1)) slightly decreased serum glucose levels (approximate to 1.1-fold) and increased insulin levels (approximate to 1.2-fold) in diabetic rats, reducing the hyperglycemic peak in healthy rats (approximate to 1.1-fold). Oat-bean cookies (0.8 and 1.2g kg(-1)) exerted a greater hypolipidemic effect than commercial oat-wheat cookies (1.2g kg(-1)), as observed in decreased serum triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, the supplementation with 1.2g kg(-1) oat-bean cookies decreased atherogenic index and serum C-reactive protein levels, suggesting their cardioprotective potential. The beneficial effect of oat-bean cookies was associated with their high content of dietary fiber and galacto oligosaccharides, as well as chlorogenic acid, rutin, protocatechuic acid, -sitosterol and soyasaponins. CONCLUSIONThese results suggest that common beans can be used as functional ingredients for the elaboration of cookies with anti-diabetic effects.

"A multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) approach is described for the simultaneous detection of DNA from four common cereal ingredients in foods: wheat, barley, rye and oats. The method uses species-specific MLPA half-probes targeting DNA fragments from the ribosomal internal space transcriber (ITS) region for the detection of barley and oats, and from the genes encoding the low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin and the omega-secalin for wheat and rye, respectively. After hybridization, the probes are ligated and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) into specific and size-differential amplicons that are simultaneously detected by capillary electrophoresis. The cereal MLPA technique showed an optimal specificity against a representative number of plant and animal species. A sensitive detection of the targets (LOD of 50 mg kg(-1)) was achieved in a reference model cake experimentally spiked with different levels of each wheat, barley, rye and oats seeds. MLPA applicability was assessed through the analysis of 40 commercial food products with different labeling declarations regarding the targets (contain, may contain and do not declare/gluten free), indicating the presence of non-declared cereal ingredients in some of the tested samples. MLPA results were further confirmed by simplex Taqman real-time PCR assays. The described MLPA technique is a reliable and sensitive tool for screening the presence of low amounts of wheat, barley, rye and oats in processed foodstuffs, contributing to compliance with authenticity legal requirements and protecting consumers from fraudulent commercial practices or adventitious contamination which may lead to allergic reactions associated to cereal proteins ingestion.

"Oats, in addition to cholesterol-lowering properties, contain unique antioxidants called avenanthramides (Avns), which inhibit both inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells in culture. This study evaluated the effects of Avns of oats on atherosclerosis in Ldlr(-/-) mice, one of the most commonly used atherosclerosis mouse models with their similar cholesterol distributions to humans. The LdIr(-/-) mice were fed a low fat, high fat, high fat containing regular oat brans with low levels of Avns (HFLA), or high fat containing regular oat brans with high levels of Avns (HFHA) diet. After 16 weeks of intervention, blood cholesterol and extent of aortic lesions were evaluated. We found that both oat-based diets reduced high fat diet-induced atheroma lesions in the aortic valve (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the effects of oat-based diets are more profound in HFHA mice than mice fed HFLA. Total plasma cholesterol levels were similarly reduced in both oat-supplemented mice. We concluded that oat bran diets reduce atheroma lesions and higher levels of Avns further reduce aortic lesions compared to regular oat bran. These preliminary in vivo data indicate that consumption of oats bran, with high Avns, has demonstrable beneficial effects on prevention of cardiovascular disease.",180,1,1,99,1,1,4,0,0,1,197
"The objectives of this research were to determine the phenolic contents, oxygen radical absorbance capacities (ORAC), cellular antioxidant activities (CAA), and antiproliferative capacities of nine oat varieties and four brans in China. Of all varieties, Longyan 3 and Beiyan 1 exhibited the highest total avenan-thramides (146.94 +/- 7.31 and 120.95 +/- 6.66 mu g/g, respectively) and ORAC values (21.03 +/- 0.56 and 21.18 +/- 1.45 mu M Trolox/g, respectively), while Shaotong exhibited the highest total phenolic acids (143.52 +/- 9.42 mu g/g) and CAA values (33.38 +/- 1.74 mu M quercetin/100 g). The EC50 of antiproliferative capacities ranged from 167.31 +/- 6.42 to 233.42 +/- 21.31 mu g/mL, with the lowest in Beixiao 8 while the highest in Jinyan 8. ORAC values correlated with avenanthramides while CAA values correlated with phenolic acids.

"Background and objectivesThe effects of Chinese steamed bread (CSB) flour fortification with -glucan (1%-5% of wheat flour) from yeast and oat (YG, 7.4x10(6) and OG, 1.3x10(7)) on the rheological properties of dough and specific volume, texture, and staling characteristics of CSB, a kind of traditional fermented food but it lacks dietary fiber, have been compared. FindingsThe addition of -glucan to the dough formula increased the farinograph water absorption, dough development time, and the resistance to deformation but decreased the dough stability, dough weakening degree, extensibility, peak, hold, final and setback viscosity, and retrogradation value; OG exerted a greater effect than did YG. Chinese steamed bread (CSB) with 1%-2% OG or YG addition possessed the higher specific volume and resilience and showed the similar hardness, springness, cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness compared to the control; while, CSB with 4%-5% OG or YG addition exhibited a smaller specific volume, a larger hardness and the similar springness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, and resilience than did the control. -glucan addition resulted in the higher freezable and unfreezable water content and in the lower firmness and amylopectin retrogradation during storage at 25 degrees C, thus retarded CSB staling. Conclusions-glucan at 1%-2% addition levels was more effective in helping to soften CSB and preventing CSB staling. Significance and noveltyConditions that -glucans incorporation increased the water-holding capacity of CSB, restricted water migration, and retarded the long-term starch retrogradation, thus softening CSB and preventing CSB staling.",183,99,99,1,1,99,2,0,0,3,236
"Effective near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) predictive calibrations were developed for simultaneous multiple component measurement of constituents (protein, oil, and beta-glucan contents) in whole and ground oat groats. The use of whole oat groats as a starting material represents an advancement in the science as it precludes the need for sample grinding. Samples were collected from the 2015 and 2016 crop years from various locations in the United States (South Dakota, North Dakota, Washington, Iowa, and Wisconsin), representing a large geographical region and diverse genetic range (N = 500). Predictive calibration equations were developed based on the modified partial least squares (MPLS) regression technique. Reference analyses were done using standard methods approved by AACC International and AOCS (AACCI Method 32-23.01 for beta-glucan content, AACCI Method 46-30.01 for crude protein content, AOCS Standard Procedure Am 5-04 for oil content, and AACCI Method 44-15.02 for moisture content). The use of validation sample sets for each constituent, which were independent of samples used in NIRS calibration development, served as additional evidence of accuracy and precision. High coefficient of determination (R-2) and one minus variance ratio (1-VR) and low standard error of calibration (SEC) and standard error of cross-validation (SECV) values provided evidence supporting the accuracy and precision of the calibration models developed for estimation of oat beta-glucan, protein, and oil contents. The NIRS calibration for estimation of beta-glucan content of ground oat groats yielded R-2, SEC, SECV, and 1-VR values of 0.94, 0.16, 0.22, and 0.87, respectively. Protein calibration for ground oat groats yielded R-2, 1-VR, SEC, and SECV values of 0.94, 0.93, 0.61, and 0.64, respectively.

"Self-aggregates of octenylsuccinate oat beta-glucan (A(OSG)) have been verified as nanocapsules to load curcumin, a representative of hydrophobic phytochemicals. This study primarily investigated the stability of curcumin-loaded A(OSG)s over food processing, storage and digestive fluids. Curcumin in A(OSG)s showed better stability over storage and thermal treatment than its free form. Curcumin loaded in A(OSGs) stored at 4 degrees C in the dark exhibited higher stability than that at higher temperatures or exposed to light. Approximately 18% of curcumin was lost after five freeze-thaw cycles. Curcumin in A(OSG) was more stable than its free form in mimetic intestinal fluids, attesting to the effective protection of A(OSG) for curcumin over digestive environments. When curcumin-loaded A(OSG) travelled across mimetic gastric and intestinal fluids, curcumin was tightly accommodated in the capsule, while it rapidly escaped as the capsule reached the colon. Interestingly, the curcumin loaded in A(OSG) generated higher values of C-max and area under the curve than did its free counterpart. These observations showed that A(OSG) is a powerful vehicle for stabilizing hydrophobic phytochemicals in food processing and storage, facilitating their colontargeted delivery and enhancing their bioavailability.",185,99,1,99,1,1,3,0,0,2,184

"The aim of the study was to determine the effect of two defatting methods on antioxidant activities and polyphenol contents of oat milling fractions. Whole flour (WF), medium oat bran (MB), fine bran (FB) and low bran (LB) were defatted with hexane or supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) fluid and then extracted with aqueous methanol. Oil yields from SC-CO2 extractions were 3.1-5.3% compared to 2.3-5% for hexane extraction yields. Three main avenanthramides (AVs) and five phenolic acids, vanillic, caffeic, para-coumaric, ferulic and cinnamic acids were quantified by HPLC. The AV contents of three of the defatted flour/bran samples (WF, LB, FB) were 1.7-2.4-fold higher when SC-CO2 was used instead of hexane. However, for MB sample, using SC-CO2 resulted in lower concentration of AVs (but not phenolic acids) compared to hexane implying that its larger particle size was a limiting factor for AVs only during the SC-CO2 step. FB had the highest amount of AVs (358.9 mu g/g) compared to other samples (172.1-277.8 mu g/g). The same trend was observed for phenolic acids. HPLC data corrected (p < 0.001) with ROO center dot scavenging activities. FB-SC-CO2 had the highest ROO center dot activity (23.0 mu M TE/g) and highest inhibition of HO center dot radicals (25.5%). In summary, SC-CO2 and fine particles were better facilitated the extraction of polyphenols in the defatted fraction and yielded higher radical scavenging activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background: Habitual consumption of eggs has been hypothesized to positively modify biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk through proposed antioxidant properties. Objectives: To examine this relationship, 50 young, healthy men and women were enrolled into a randomized crossover clinical intervention. Methods: Participants consumed either 2 eggs per day or one packet of oatmeal a day for 4 weeks, followed by a 3-week wash-out and crossed over to the alternate breakfast. Fasting blood samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected at the end of each intervention period. Results: Increases in plasma large high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and large low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle concentrations as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance were found following egg consumption (p < 0.001, p < 0.05), respectively, with increases in apolipoprotein concentration as well (p < 0.05). Though there was no difference in the intake of antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, a significant increase in plasma concentrations of these carotenoids was observed (p < 0.001) after egg consumption. There was no change in lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase, cholesteryl ester transfer protein, or paroxanase-1 arylesterase activities between breakfast interventions. Dietary and plasma choline were both higher following egg consumption compared to oatmeal consumption (p < 0.001); however, there was no change in plasma trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) concentrations. Two eggs per day had no impact on PBMC gene expression related to cholesterol metabolism, oxidation, or TMAO production. Conclusions: These results suggest that compared to oatmeal, consumption of 2 eggs for breakfast provided increased plasma carotenoids and improved biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk while not affecting TMAO levels in this population.",188,0,99,0,1,99,1,0,2,2,260
"This paper examines the effect of emulsion gels (EG) prepared with chia (CEG) and oats (OEG) used as animal fat replacers in reduced-fat fresh sausages (longaniza) (LRF) during chilled storage. Reduced-fat samples were reformulated with CEG and OEG, (LRF/CEG and LRF/OEG respectively). Normal (LNF/P) and reduced-fat (LRF/P) (all-pork-fat) sausages were used as controls. Nutritional composition and microbiological, technological and sensory characteristics of sausages were evaluated. The presence of an EG affected (P < 0.05) the concentrations of some minerals and amino acids in sausages. CEG improved MUFA and PUFA contents. Cooking loss was lower (P < 0.05) in LRF/CEG and LRF/OEG than in the controls. Of all the reduced-fat samples, Kramer shear force values (KSF) were highest (P < 0.05) in the ones containing an EG. KSF generally increased (P < 0.05) over storage in all samples. The microbial count was significantly affected by the use of CEG.

"Scope: Wholegrain has been associated with reduced chronic disease mortality, with oat intake particularly notable for lowering blood cholesterol and glycemia. To better understand the complex nutrient profile of oats, we studied urinary excretion of phenolic acids and avenanthramides after ingestion of oat bran in humans. Methods and results: After a 2-d (poly)phenol-low diet, seven healthy men provided urine 12 h before and 48 h after consuming 60 g oat bran (7.8 mu mol avenanthramides, 139.2 mu mol phenolic acids) or a phenolic-low (traces of phenolics) control in a crossover design. Analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-MS/MS showed that oat bran intake resulted in an elevation in urinary excretion of 30 phenolics relative to the control, suggesting that they are oat bran-derived. Mean excretion levels were elevated between 0-2 and 4-8 h, following oat bran intake, and amounted to a total of 33.7 +/- 7.3 mu mol total excretion (mean recovery: 22.9 +/- 5.0%), relative to control. The predominant metabolites included: vanillic acid, 4- and 3-hydroxyhippuric acids, and sulfate-conjugates of benzoic and ferulic acids, which accounted collectively for two thirds of total excretion. Conclusion: Oat bran phenolics follow a relatively rapid urinary excretion, with 30 metabolites excreted within 8 h of intake. These levels of excretion suggest that bound phenolics are, in part, rapidly released by the microbiota.",190,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,219

"Oats, both separately and as part of other dishes, refer to that healthy food that is regularly consumed by the broad masses of the population of various countries. Oats are a grain crop with a high level of nutrients, such as proteins, fats, minerals and vitamins. The oat grain from other cereals is distinguished by a high protein content and the unique composition of essential amino acids. The high content of beta-glucan-soluble fiber allows us to consider oats as part of the complex therapy and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

"Oat bran (OB) and psyllium husk fibre (PF) were incorporated into magwinya (fat cake) - a cereal fried dough with the aim of reducing oil content and evaluating some of its physicochemical properties using one-factor of the response surface methodology. Two methods of magwinya processing were employed: traditional (TM) and modified (MM) methods. Addition of PF and OB significantly (p<0.05) reduced oil in MM compared to TM. Lowest oil content for PF and OB magwinya were 3.10 and 4.35% using MM and 6.00 and 6.25% for TM. Addition of PF up to 3% and OB up to 2% significantly improved textural properties. Comparing the additives and the method of production, optimum conditions with highest desirability of 0.83 was obtained for OB modified magwinya with 35.08% moisture, 2.31% ash and 4.74% oil. Hence, the use of MM and OB reduced oil absorption. RESUMENSe incorporo salvado de trigo (OB) y fibra de cascara de psilio (PF) a la magwinya una especie de bunuelo frito, elaborado con cereales con el fin de reducir su contenido de aceite y evaluar algunas de sus propiedades fisicoquimicas, para lo cual se empleo uno de los factores de la metodologia de superficies de respuesta. Con este objetivo se utilizaron dos metodos de elaboracion de la magwinya: metodo tradicional (TM) y metodos modificados (MM). La adicion de PF y OB redujo significativamente (p<0.05) el aceite en aquella preparada mediante MM en comparacion con la preparada por TM. El contenido de aceite mas bajo de la magwinya hecha con PF y OB fue 3,10% y 4,35% usando MM, y 6,00% y 6,25% para TM.

"Oat avenanthramides (AVAs) are a group of phenolic alkaloids, consisting of an anthranilic acid and a hydroxycinnamic acid linked by a pseudo-peptide bond. Bioavailability of AVA is poor in humans, suggesting transformations for rapid excretion. Thus, we aim to identify metabolites of AVA isomers in plasma of humans after consuming AVA-enriched oats. After lipid removal, AVA and their metabolites in plasma were extracted with ethyl acetate and analysed using an Agilent UHPLC-QToF-MS. Pharmacokinetics of AVA-O showed a bimodal distribution with C(max)1 and 2 for AVA-O at 5.9 +/- 5.2 and 7.9 +/- 7.0ng/mL and T(max)1 and 2 at 1.7 +/- 0.7 and 3.1 +/- 1.2h, respectively. Only the methyl-AVA-O showed a single C-max at 14 +/- 9.9ng/mL AVA-O equivalents and a T-max of 2.4 +/- 2.7h. This analysis is the first to identify methylated metabolites of AVAs and AVA aglycones in human blood after acute AVA consumption.",196,0,1,1,0,99,2,0,2,1,147
"During the harvesting of husked oats (Avena sativa L.), the kernel remains tightly enclosed by a lignified lemma and palea, collectively termed the husk or hull. In naked oats, which are the same species as husked oats, the lemma is much less lignified and the kernel threshes free during harvesting. The absence of the largely indigestible husk increases the nutritive value of naked oats compared to that of husked oats, particularly for non-ruminants and poultry. There is little information regarding the potential of naked oats as an arable crop in Ireland. The objective of this study was to determine the productivity of naked oats under Irish conditions. Field experiments were carried out in the south east of Ireland to compare the grain yield and grain quality of both autumn-sown and spring-sown naked and husked oat cultivars. Grain yield of naked oat cultivars was significantly lower than that of husked oat cultivars, irrespective of whether they were autumn sown or spring sown. However, when the kernel yield of husked oat cultivars was estimated, differences in yield between the two types were much smaller, and in some cases, kernel yield of naked oat cultivars exceeded that of husked oat cultivars. Grain quality, as indicated by hectolitre weight and grain N concentration, was generally greater for naked oat cultivars than for husked oat cultivars. It is concluded that under Irish conditions, naked oats have the potential to produce kernel yields equivalent to husked oats. The grain produced is of high quality and may be particularly suited for the nutrition of non-ruminants.",197,99,1,1,99,99,2,0,0,3,258
"Loaf volume and crumb structure of oat bread are not comparable to those of bread from wheat flour. Hydrocolloids, surfactants and/or enzymes are often included in oat batter recipes for quality enhancement reasons. In this study, we examined the impact of water-extractable components from barley, oat, rye and wheat flour on oat bread quality. We speculated that such water extracts contain components which also would enhance the quality of oat bread. As expected, extract protein, non-starch polysaccharide, lipid and enzyme levels varied widely amongst the different cereal flours used. The extracts also varied in foaming properties and extract viscosities. Rye flour contained the highest level of water-extractable components. Inclusion of rye aqueous extract resulted in the largest loaf volume increase and in softer crumb than noted for control oat bread. Rheofermentometer analyses showed that the moment of gas cell opening was delayed when rye extract was added, indicating improved batter gas cell stabilization, while collapse during baking was not affected. The oat bread improving effect of the rye extract is likely due to a combination of the impact of different of its constituents such as enzymes and surface active components. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Unlike wheat bread, the dough of which has a visco-elastic network and high gas-holding capacity, oat bread generally has a low volume and a dense structure. We showed earlier that including rye water extractable components in an oat bread batter recipe increases loaf volume by ca. 30% (Pauly and Delcour, submitted as back-to-back publication). We here report on efforts to identify the active factor(s). Anion exchange chromatography allowed enriching the active factor(s). This and the fact that only a limited volume increase was observed when oat batter was supplemented with boiled rye extract indicate that proteins are likely the most important components responsible for the volume increase. While the most active factor(s) had a pl below 4.5, components with pl values between 4.5 and 8.5 also contributed to oat loaf volume. Alkaline rye components (pl > 8.5) or rye arabinoxylan had no impact. Rye water-extractable components smaller than 6-8 kDa also had a positive impact on loaf volume. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Obtaining representative test samples for antibody based testing is challenging when analyzing whole grains for gluten. When whole grains are ground into flour for testing, confocal microscopy studies have shown that gluten tends to exist as aggregates within the starch background, making single-sample testing inaccurate and complicating the ability to arrive at an accurate average from multiple samples. In addition, whole-grain products present a unique risk to gluten free consumers, in that any contamination is localized to specific servings rather than being distributed across the product lot. This makes parts-per-million values less relevant for whole-grain products. Intact grains, seeds, beans, pulses, and legumes offer an alternative opportunity for gluten detection, in that contaminating gluten-containing grains (GCGs) are visible and identifiable to the trained eye or properly calibrated optical sorting equipment. The purpose of the current study was to determine a Gluten Free Certification Organization threshold level for the maximum number of GCGs within a kilogram of nongluten grains sold as specially processed gluten free product and to determine the feasibility of this threshold by evaluating visual examination data from two major oat processors.",200,1,99,99,-1,0,1,1,1,2,183
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the time of heat-moisture treatment (HMT) of oat grains in husk on lipase activity, pasting properties of flour, and properties of starch isolated from grains. Oat grains with 13% moisture were subjected to 15, 30, 45, and 60 min of HMT at 110 degrees C. Starches of heat-moisture-treated oat grains were isolated with the alkaline method. The 60-min HMT suppressed more than 60% of the lipase activity of oat grains and increased the extraction yield of oat starch. HMT also reduced swelling power, solubility, gelatinisation enthalpy, and relative crystallinity of starches isolated from oat grains. The reduction of breakdown and retrogradation of oat flour promoted by 60 min of HMT provides better paste stability, and thus can be used for canned and frozen foods.",201,1,-1,1,1,99,3,1,0,1,135
"BACKGROUNDOat protein concentrate is often used in human food, but the quality of this protein has not been characterized. Therefore, the objectives of this experiment were to determine the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) in oat protein concentrate and to determine differences in protein quality estimates between the protein digestibility-corrected AA score (PDCAAS) and the digestible indispensable AA score (DIAAS) when using growing pigs for both measurements. RESULTSFor infants, the most limiting AA in oat protein concentrate was the aromatic AA (Phe + Tyr), for which the DIAAS value was 41 and the PDCAAS was 43. For children (6 months to 3 years) and children older than 3 years, the most limiting AA in oat protein concentrate was Lys, for which the DIAAS was 56 and 67 and the PDCAAS was 58 and 69, respectively. CONCLUSIONThe DIAAS value for oat protein concentrate was close to the calculated value for PDCAAS, but below the recommended intake for protein. Therefore, to satisfy the daily human AA requirement, oat protein needs to be complemented by other proteins of higher quality and specifically with greater lysine concentrations.

"Dairy products have conventionally been used as carriers of probiotics. However, lactose intolerance, cholesterol, allergenic milk proteins, and the trend towards vegetarianism motivated the search for non-dairy products as potential probiotic carriers. Cereals may represent an excellent choice due to their high nutritional value and consumption all around the world. In the present study, an oat based fermented product 'probiotic fermented oat flour' (PFOF) was developed using a probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum M-13 and honey. The bacterial isolate L. plantarum M-13 has previously been characterized for several probiotic functional attributes. For PFOF development, process variables, i.e., concentrations of oat flour (8.0% w/v) and honey (3.0% w/v), and incubation time (48 h) were optimized based on a Box-Behnken design. Optimization enhanced the viable cell count of L. plantarum M-13 in PFOF from 14.4 log cfu/ml (unoptimized conditions) to 16.9 log cfu/ml, i.e. by 17.4%. With respect to linear terms, the variable incubation time had the most substantial positive influence on viable cell count of L. plantarum M-13, while with respect to interactive terms, the variables incubation time and honey had the maximum effect. Good viability of L. plantarum M-13 was observed in PFOF over a period of three wk of storage at room temperature and with refrigeration. Furthermore, sugar content decreased and lactic acid content increased during storage. The PFOF remained free of Enterobacteriaceae contamination, although fungal and yeast contaminants were found.",203,99,-1,99,1,1,2,1,0,2,231
"Improvement of oat lines via introgression is an important process for food biochemical functionality. This work aims to evaluate the protective effect of phenolic compounds from hybrid Oat line (F11-5) and its parent (Amlal) on hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and to establish the possible mechanisms of antidiabetic activity by digestive enzyme inhibition. Eight phenolic acids were quantified in our samples including ferulic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, salicylic, syringic, sinapic, p-coumaric and chlorogenic acids. The Oat extract (2000 mg/kg) ameliorated the glucose tolerance, decreased Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) and oxidative stress markers, including Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Glutathione (GSH) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) in rat liver and kidney. Furthermore, Metformin and Oat intake prevented anxiety, hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in diabetic rats. In vivo anti-hyperglycemic effect of Oat extracts has been confirmed by their inhibitory activities on -amylase (723.91 mu g/mL and 1027.14 g/mL) and alpha-glucosidase (1548.12 mu g/mL & 1803.52 mu g/mL) enzymes by mean of a mixed inhibition.",204,1,99,99,1,-1,2,1,0,2,158
"Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 is a probiotic that has been shown to reduce the risk of urogenital problems and urinary tract infections. Rice pudding is a popular gluten-free dairy product, and could be a vehicle to deliver L. rhamnosus GR-1 to a broader population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the growth and viability of L. rhamnosus GR-1 in six fermented rice pudding samples, each one supplemented with one type of prebiotic (short-chain inulin-2% w/w, 4% w/w; long-chain inulin-2% w/w, 4% w/w) and oat-0.5% w/w, 1% w/w, along with control, over a 21-day storage period. The objective was to determine if the supplementation would have a positive effect on the microbial viability of L. rhamnosus GR-1, and to evaluate the sensory properties of the samples. All of the samples had viable levels of L. rhamnosus GR-1. Bacterial counts were at least 1 x 10(8) CFU/mL over the 21-day storage period. The probiotic rice pudding sample supplemented with 4% w/w short-chain inulin had the highest hedonic score for flavour, sweetness, texture, and overall acceptability. This study shows that the addition of short-chain inulin, long-chain inulin, and oat had no adverse supplementation effects on the viability of L. Rhamnosus GR-1.

"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in regulating hypertension by controlling vasoconstriction and intravascular fluid volume. RAAS itself is largely regulated by the actions of renin (EC 3.4.23.15) and the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE-I; EC 3.4.15.1). The enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV; EC 3.4.14.5) also plays a role in the development of type-2 diabetes. The inhibition of the renin, ACE-I, and DPP-IV enzymes has therefore become a key therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess the bioactivity of different oat (Avena sativa) protein isolates and their ability to inhibit the renin, ACE-I, and DPP-IV enzymes. In silico analysis was carried out to predictthe likelihood of bioactive inhibitory peptides occurring from oat protein hydrolysates following in silico hydrolysis with the proteases papain and ficin. Nine peptides, including FFG, IFFFL, PFL, WWK, WCY, FPIL, CPA, FLLA, and FEPL were subsequently chemically synthesised, and their bioactivities were confirmed using in vitro bioassays. The isolated oat proteins derived from seven different oat varieties were found to inhibit the ACE-I enzyme by between 86.5 +/- 10.7% and 96.5 +/- 25.8%, renin by between 40.5 +/- 21.5% and 70.9 +/- 7.6%, and DPP-IV by between 3.7 +/- 3.9% and 46.2 +/- 28.8%.

"Amaranth, sorghum and oats flour was used to prepare mix flour (MF). Composite flour (CF) was prepared by replacing wheat flour with MF at various proportions i. e. 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%. The physical and functional properties of different blends of composite flour were studied. Cookies were prepared by using different ratios of composite flour. The various properties of multigrain cookies were investigated. In composite flour, with increase in blending proportion, fat and carbohydrate content increased. Water absorption capacity (WAC) increased as the blending proportion was increased. Foaming stability (FS) gradually decreased with increase in blending proportions. In cookies, it was found that that the diameter of the cookies decreased with increasing level of supplementation, whereas with increase in level of supplementation, hardness of cookies increased.

"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the incorporation of oat -glucan (OG) on the sensory and nutritional quality of steamed bread. Wheat flour was substituted with OG at levels varying from 0 g/100 g to 5 g/100 g. The results showed that the products containing 1 g/100 g and 3 g/100 g OG produced a comparable overall consumer acceptance while a significantly lower score was given to the product with 5 g/100 g. Nutritionally, the presence of OG impeded in vitro starch hydrolysis by amylolytic enzymes. More importantly, the addition of OG up to 5 g/100 g did bring about a lower in vitro predicted glycaemic index to steamed bread, but it generated insignificant effects on the in vivo glycaemic response. The current work first demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating OG-enriched steamed bread and its nutritional superiority compared to the corresponding normal product. Practical applicationsModern methods of food elaboration and processing frequently reduce the content of dietary fiber (DF). Despite the well-known health benefits of DF consumption, average intake levels still fall far below recommended ones. Oat -glucan (OG) is a kind of indigestible polysaccharide with diverse bioactivity. This article evaluated the effects of OG incorporation on quality, structure, consumer acceptance, and glycaemic response of steamed bread. The addition of less than 3 g/100 g of OG had negligible effects on the consumer acceptance of steamed bread. The enrichment at 5 g/100 g indeed deteriorated the consumer acceptance. Moreover, OG highly lowered the glycaemic response of steamed bread. The current work first demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating OG-enriched steamed bread and its nutritional superiority compared to the corresponding normal product. OG enriched steamed bread may offer an alternative to improve DF intake of residents.",208,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,289
"Wheat and oat brans, by-products of grain processing, were investigated in the form of gels for partial replacement of fat. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal bran concentration, homogenization temperature and time to create bran gel/vegetable fat model systems (BGF model systems) with similar dynamic rheological properties and spreadability to the control fat. The response surface methodology approach based on Derringer's desirability function was applied, and the highest overall desirability was accomplished with the following parameters: 22.0 g/100 g of bran concentration, 11.7 min homogenization time and 83.2 degrees C homogenization temperature (for the wheat bran) and bran concentration of 22.0 g/100 g, homogenization time of 10.0 min and homogenization temperature of 95.0 degrees C (for the oat bran). Oat bran required higher homogenization temperature since its structure was mostly built upon starch gelatinization, while wheat bran was capable of making gels under lower temperatures due to fibre cross-linking.

"The objective of this study was to develop biscuit that contains whole oat flour (5-15%) maltodextrin (1-3%) and isomalt (10-20%) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) as the optimization technique. For this purpose, the biscuit samples were analyzed. The analysis was based on hardness of the biscuit, fracturability, penetration force value and overall acceptability scores. The results showed that increasing the amount of whole oat flour and isomalt in biscuit decreased the hardness and penetration force value, whereas, fracturability increased. Overall acceptability scores increased up to the level at which whole oat flour was 10% after which it decreased. An increase in the amount of maltodextrin was followed by an increase penetration force value, while hardness decreased. Optimization suggested biscuit containing 11.39% whole oat flour, 16.73% isomalt and 2.2% maltodextrin as the best proportion of these components. Optimized biscuit had improved protein (15.43%), ash (2.76%), carbohydrate (58.08%) and specially fibre (4.07%) in addition to acceptable textural characteristics.",210,99,1,1,99,99,2,0,0,3,156

"An accurate and precise ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was validated for the analysis of glyphosate and its main transformation product (aminomethylphosphonic acid) in barley, malt, wheat, oats, and lentils. The validation data demonstrated good performance of the method. This UHPLC-MS/MS method was also used to evaluate the performance of a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kit. For all of the grain matrices examined, the ELISA showed poor accuracy and precision at its stated lower working limit of 0.075 mg/kg; however, performance was acceptable at 0.30 mg/kg, as well as higher concentrations relevant to established maximum residue limits. At these relevant concentrations, the ELISA also produced results higher than the UHPLC-MS/MS method. Although results from the two methods were linearly correlated, differences in the result values from the two methods differed among the grains studied and ranged from +1% for oats to +40% for glyphosate concentrations in barley.

"Oat beta-glucan has been shown to play a positive role in influencing lipid and cholesterol metabolism. However, the mechanisms behind these beneficial effects are not fully understood. The purpose of the current work was to investigate some of the possible mechanisms behind the cholesterol lowering effect of oat beta-glucan, and how processing of oat modulates lipolysis. beta-Glucan release, and the rate and extent of lipolysis measured in the presence of different sources of oat beta-glucan, were investigated during gastrointestinal digestion. Only a fraction of the original beta-glucan content was released during digestion. Oat flakes and flour appeared to have a more significant effect on lipolysis than purified beta-glucan. These findings show that the positive action of beta-glucan is likely to involve complex processes and interactions with the food matrix.

"The aim was to study lipase, lipoxygenase (LOX) and peroxygenase (PDX) activities in oat and faba bean samples to be able to evaluate their potential in formation of lipid-derived off-flavours. Lipase and LOX activities were measured by spectroscopy, and PDX activities via the formation of epoxides. An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography method was developed to study the formation of fatty acid epoxides. The epoxides of esters were measured by gas chromatography. Mass spectroscopy was used to verify the identity of the epoxides. Both oat and faba bean possessed high lipase activities. In faba bean, LOX catalysed the formation of hydroperoxides, whose break-down products are the likely cause of off-flavours. Since oat had low LOX activity, autoxidation is needed to initiate lipid oxidation. Oat had high PDX activity, which is able to convert hydroperoxides to epoxy and hydroxy fatty acids that could contribute significantly to off-flavours. PDX activity in the faba bean was low. Thus, in faba bean volatile lipid oxidation products could rapidly be formed by LOX, whereas in oat reactions are slower due to the need of autoxidation prior to further reactions.",214,0,0,99,99,0,0,0,3,2,183
"The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of the enzyme assisted bioprocessing with xylanase and sourdough fermentation on the rheological properties of dough, antioxidant properties and bread quality supplemented with oat bran. Mixing and starch pasting properties of the dough were studied with Mixolab device. The addition of 10, 20 and 30% oat bran to the wheat flour induced significantly increase (P<0.05) of dough development time and dough weakening. Increasing the substitution level of wheat flour by oat bran resulted in decreased starch gelatinization temperature. Torque value related to starch gelling decreased from 2.470 to 2.224 N m, while cooking stability increased from 0.129 to 0.387 N m. Both enzymatic bioprocessing and sourdough addition allowed improving the bread specific volume and crumb hardness, especially because of the modification of the ratio between soluble and insoluble fibers. Moreover, enzymatic bioprocessing and sourdough fermentation increased the total phenolic contents of the bread. Practical ApplicationsUsing bioprocessing we can reduce the negative effect of bran addition on the dough rheology such as dough development time, dough stability and starch behavior during baking. Moreover, the bread quality in terms of specific volume and crumb hardness is also improving. The addition of different levels of oat bran in wheat flour can be used in order to improve the nutritional properties of bread, in order to enhance the health benefits of bread consumption.",215,1,99,99,1,1,3,0,0,2,229
"The beta-glucan fiber has been used to change the consistency, water activity, and fat binding capacity (FB), promoting viscosity, gelification or emulsification, in foods. Its properties are related to their structure, which can be modified chemically, enzymatically, and physically. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oxidation under soft conditions (0.05 mL 100 g(-1) and 0.10 mL 100 g(-1) H2O2 for 10 and 20 min) on the functional, thermal, and rheological properties of oat -glucan. The soft oxidation of -glucan at higher levels of oxidant increased the power of swelling and bile acids binding capacity, resulting in a higher hypocholesterolemic effect. In the same levels, the texture profile of oxidized -glucans gels showed a reduction in hardness and lack of adhesiveness, as well as an increase in springiness and gumminess. The viscosity of -glucan decreased after oxidation and showed pseudoplastic behavior. Practical applications-glucan solutions can easily suffer molecular breakdown due to different processes, which may alter the effectiveness of health benefits due to their relationship with the viscosity. Among the possible modifications to which polysaccharides like -glucan may be submitted, oxidation stands out.

"Olive pomace, a waste stream from olive oil processing, was fractionated by centrifugation to obtain a supernatant and a flesh-enriched fraction, and freeze dried to obtain a powder. The dried supernatant contained 5.8% moisture, 4.8% protein, 3.5% fat, 3.5% ash, 82.4% carbohydrate (including 17.2% dietary fiber) and poly phenols (2970 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 g). The dried flesh-enriched fraction, contained 5.9% moisture, 13.4% protein, 14.2% fat, 3.5% ash, 63.1% carbohydrate (including 42.7% dietary fiber) and poly phenols (1960 mg GAE/100 g). The extruded products using rice-oat flour or maize-oat flour mixtures as the base were formulated to contain 5% or 10% olive pomace fractions (dry basis). The extruded products with added olive pomace fractions has higher fiber (2-7 g/100 g) and polyphenol contents (67-161 mg GAE/100 g) compared to the corresponding mixtures of rice-oat flour base (0.92 g/100 g fiber, 20 mg GAE/100 g) or maize oat flour base (3.2 g/100 g fiber, 20 mg GAE/100 g) without olive pomace fractions. Addition of olive pomace fractions reduced the die pressure and specific mechanical energy during extrusion and resulted in lower radial expansion in the extruded product. The impact of the addition of olive pomace fraction on physical characteristics of the extruded product is higher for rice-oat flour base than maize-oat flour base. The underlining mechanism was explained by FTIR analysis. FTIR showed that there were significant changes in the carbohydrate components and the structure of the proteins on extrusion, with consequent effects on the expansion and density of the extruded product. This study showed the feasibility of preparing fiber and polyphenol enriched extruded products by incorporation of olive pomace.

"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most important mycotoxins owing to its widespread occurrence and toxicity, including nephrotoxicity and potential carcinogenicity to humans. OTA has been detected in a wide range of agricultural commodities, including cereal grains and their processed products. In particular, oat-based products show a higher incidence and level of contamination. Extrusion cooking is widely used in the manufacturing of breakfast cereals and snacks and may reduce mycotoxins to varying degrees. Hence, the effects of extrusion cooking on the stability of OTA in spiked (100 mu g/kg) oat flake was investigated by using a laboratory-scale twin-screw extruder with a central composite design. Factors examined were moisture content (20, 25, and 30% dry weight basis), temperature (140, 160, and 180 degrees C), screw speed (150, 200, and 250 rpm), and die size (1.5, 2, and 3 mm). Both nonextruded and extruded samples were analyzed for reductions of OTA by high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with fluorescence detection. The percentage of reductions in OTA in the contaminated oat flakes upon extrusion processing were in the range of 0 to 28%. OTA was partially stable during extrusion, with only screw speed and die size having significant effect on reduction (P < 0.005). The highest reduction of 28% was achieved at 180 degrees C, 20% moisture, 250 rpm screw speed, and a 3-mm die with 193 kJ/kg specific mechanical energy.

"Extrusion is an effective method for the production of healthier snack foods, such as oat fibre products. The effect of this process on the physicochemical properties of oat fibre preparations containing high levels of beta-glucan, however, has not been fully addressed. Oat fibre containing 28 g/100 g beta-glucan was extruded using two levels of feed moisture (50 g/100 g or 60 g/100 g of feed materials) and two screw speeds (200 rpm or 300 rpm) at a constant barrel temperature profile (80 degrees C, 90 degrees C, 100 degrees C, 110 degrees C). A higher specific mechanical energy applied during extrusion correlated with an increase in specific surface area, greater sorption of water vapour and higher sorption energy for the monolayer of water associated with the surface of extruded products. The pasting properties of oat fibre were largely retained and the extent of molecular fragmentation was small, as the molecular weight of the soluble fraction, total soluble solids and water absorption index were not significantly altered. These data demonstrate that extrusion under these conditions can be applied to oat fibre preparations with high beta-glucan content, resulting in oat products that retain their functional properties and potential health benefits.

"Extrudates were prepared from a blue corn, yellow pea and oat bran blend employing a twin-screw extruder. Response surface methodology was used to evaluate the effect of extrusion-cooking process independent variables: screw speed (SS, 300-400 rpm), die temperature (DT, 120-160 degrees C) and feed moisture content (FMC, 20-25%) on the system parameters (specific mechanical energy and product temperature), physical properties (sectional and specific longitudinal expansion indices, porosity, hardness and color attributes), hydration properties (water absorption and solubility indices, and pasting properties), microstructure and x-ray diffraction. Although, system parameters, physical and hydration properties were affected by SS and DT, the greatest effect was due to the FMC. Indicating this way lubricant effect as the preponderant factor controlling extrusion effects on raw material. Decreased FMC increased specific mechanical energy, expansion, soluble compounds; and decreased hardness, time to raw peak viscosity, raw peak, total setback and final viscosities. Data were also analyzed with a principal component analysis, showing that 74.67% of data variability can be explained defining two components corresponding to the 62.10% that was due to mechanical effect and 12.57% that was related to thermic effect. Conditions obtained for multiple optimization were: 158.64 degrees C, 371.98 rpm, 1838% FMC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",220,99,99,1,99,99,1,0,0,4,204
"Oat is considered as a good addition to the gluten-free diet, but it is a challenge to keep the oats segregated from other gluten-rich grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye. Therefore, oat-processing industry demands better detection tools for identifying and screening oat grain. The research goal of this study was to investigate the potential of near infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging for non-destructive and accurate discrimination of oats from barley, wheat, and rye. A procedure was developed to classify six grains (oat, dehulled oat, barley, dehulled barley, wheat and rye) using NIR hyperspectral imaging in the wavelength range of 900-1700 nm coupled with multivariate data analysis. The reflectance spectra were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (unsupervised) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (supervised) classification models to discriminate single oat kernels. Good results of dehulled oats grain prediction (99%) were achieved using only few selected key wavelengths (1069, 1126, 1189, 1243, and 1413 nm). Our results establish that NIR hyperspectral imaging has potential for application in on-line oat grain quality control and inspection at the different stages of industrial processing.

"Oat and faba bean protein isolates were treated with transglutaminase from Streptomyces mobaraensis and tyrosinase from Trichoderma reesei to modify the colloidal properties of protein particles in order to improve their colloidal stability and foaming properties. Transglutaminase crosslinked faba bean protein extensively already with 10 nkat/g enzyme dosage. Oat protein was crosslinked to some extent with transglutaminase with higher dosages (100 and 1000 nkat/g). Transglutaminase increased the absolute zeta-potential values and reduced the particle size of oat protein particles. As a result, the colloidal stability and foaming properties were improved. Tyrosinase had limited crosslinking ability on both plant protein materials. Tyrosinase greatly reduced the solubility of oat protein despite limited crosslinking. Tyrosinase did not have effect on zeta-potential or colloidal stability of either protein, but it impaired foaming properties of both. Thus, the crosslinking enzymes studied caused significantly different end product functionality, presumably due to the different mechanism of action. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"The milling potential of hulled barley, hulled oat, triticale, rye and wheat was studied using a long tempering process and a laboratory four-roller mill. Regardless of the investigated cereal, the results indicated a significant influence (p < 0.05) of volume per surface area ratio on the milling yield and ash contents of the flour. The lowest milling yield was obtained in case of hulled oat. Solvent retention capacity profiles were determined for all investigated whole cereals and flours for predicting the contribution of different polymers to the functionality of samples. For all solvents higher values were obtained for the whole cereals compared to the corresponding flour. Thermo-mechanical properties of the whole cereals and refined flours were also investigated. If in case of wheat the gluten proteins play an essential role on dough behaviour during kneading at 30 degrees C, in case of triticale, rye, hulled barley and hulled oat, the fibers play a major role as well. Thermo-mechanical properties of starch registered a large variation between cereals and/or flours. The lowest torque value corresponding to starch gelatinization (C3) was registered in case of the hulled oat flour, 1.92 Nm, while the highest value in case of rye flour, 2.65 Nm.

"It is important to understand the viscoelastic properties of cereals as they affect product texture. Therefore, the stress relaxation behavior of oat flakes was studied using static testing. The oat flakes exhibited linear viscoelastic behavior at strain levels under 2%. The relaxation modulus was directly influenced by the moisture content of the samples; it was low at higher moisture levels. A two-element generalized Maxwell model fitted well to describe the viscoelastic behavior of oat flakes with its high R-2 and low RMSE. The first and second stress coefficients (G(1) and G(2)) and the second relaxation time component (tau(2)) of the model generally decreased as the moisture content of the samples increased, which implied that samples showed lower resistance against applied force and relaxed faster with the increase in moisture content. The viscoelastic behavior of oat flakes was a function of both moisture content and temperature. The viscoelastic properties obtained in this study can be used to improve the textural attributes of oat-based products and further utilized in mathematical models describing drying or sorption processes.

"BACKGROUNDEmerging evidence suggested that the prebiotic ability of -glucan was intimately related to its molecular weight (M-w). However, the effect of oat -glucan with differing M-w on gut homeostasis was inconsistent. Importantly, knowledge of the fermentation properties of oat -glucan fractions was still limited. The present study aimed to evaluate the prebiotic potential of raw and hydrolyzed oat -glucan during in vitro fermentation by fecal microbiota and selected probiotic strains. RESULTSThe results obtained showed that both oat -glucan (OG) and hydrolysates (OGH) comparably promoted the growth of fecal Lactobacillus counts (P < 0.05). Importantly, OGH revealed greater fermentability compared to OG as denoted by lower pH value and higher short-chain fatty acid concentration (P < 0.05). Moreover, OGH was found to be more favorable to provide growth substrates for Lactobacillus helveticus R389 (LR389), Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 (LGG) and Bifidobacterium longum BB536 (BB536) than OG, and was preferentially utilized by LR389, LGG and BB536 as the sole carbon source. CONCLUSIONThe results of the present study indicate that oat -glucan hydrolysates could serve as a more promising material for developing novel symbiotic foods.

"Three commercially available oat products instant oats, steel cut oats, and oat bran-were studied using the TNO Intestinal Model-1 (TIM-1) coupled with fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular rotors to evaluate carbohydrate digestion and in vitro gastric viscosity as a function of time. A proportional relationship between total bioaccessible sugars and the concentration of available carbohydrates was observed for the different oat-based foods. The rate of starch digestion was greatest for instant oats and lowest for steel cut oats. beta-glucan, starch, and total carbohydrate concentrations were proportional to the initial gastric viscosity. Overall, gastric viscosity differed considerably between samples. Instant oat and oat bran viscosities were highest at the onset of digestion and decreased with time, whereas the viscoity of steel cut oats at the onset of digestion was the lowest viscosity observed, increasing with time. These findings suggest that modification of food form and formulation during processing alters sugar bio-accessibility and luminal viscosity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Four oat varieties and three prothict forms (porridge, cereal, and snack bar) were assessed to determine the impact of oat phenolics on starch digestibility and intestinal glucose transport. alpha-Amylase activity was enhanced by 20 GAE mu M (gallic acid equivalent) of phenolics extracted from oat (96.7-118%, p < 0.05), while it was modestly inhibited at 500 GAE mu M (83.0-95.4%). Maltose hydrolysis was reduced (49.6-82.4%, p < 0.05), albeit with high IC50 values (500-940 GAE mu M). Free and bound oat phenolic extracts dose-dependently attenuated transport of D-glucose-1,2,3,4,5,6,6-d(7) by Caco-2 monolayers over 60 min. Oat foods were then subjected to a coupled in vitro digestion/Cato-2 intestinal cell model to determine relevance to whole food systems. Digestive release of glucose was similar among products; however, glucose transport was significantly reduced from digesta of GMI 423 porridge and puffed cereal by 34% +/- 12% and 20% +/- 10% (p < 0.05) at 60 min.

"The effects of oat starch oxidation at different hydrogen peroxide concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%) on the physicochemical, crystallinity, thermal and textural properties of starch were investigated. The carbonyl content, carboxyl content, crystallinity, gelatinization characteristics, swelling power, solubility, gel hardness and gelation property of the starches were evaluated. The extraction yield of oat starch was 31.51% with 99% purity. The oxidation promoted the insertion of carbonyl and carboxyl groups and reduced the relative crystallinity, gelatinization enthalpy, swelling power, and solubility of starch. The gels of oxidized starches had a higher hardness, adhesiveness, gumminess, and a lower cohesiveness when compared to native starch gels.

"US organic poultry producers are under pressure to find feed alternatives to corn and wheat. Hulless oats offer advantages such as wide geographic adaptation of the plant and high concentrations of protein and oil in the grain. They have shown considerable potential in experimental work as a feed grain for poultry, but more research is needed into their influence on the sensory and nutritional properties of eggs. In this study, hulless oats were substituted for corn or wheat at 200 g kg(-1) in diets fed to Hy-Line Brown hens and eggs were sampled for sensory evaluation after 8 weeks. Discrimination tests of blended and baked egg samples found evidence of difference between eggs from oat-based diets and those from the oat-free control (p < 0.05 for eggs from an oat-corn diet, p < 0.01 for eggs from an oat-wheat diet). Acceptance tests of similar samples showed that eggs from the oat-wheat diet were significantly less liked than control eggs for their texture (p < 0.01) and response to cooking (p < 0.01), while eggs from the oat-corn diet were somewhat less liked. Yolk weight was greater (p < 0.05) in control eggs (34.1 g) than eggs from oat-corn (31.6 g) or oat-wheat (31.2 g) diets, leading to smaller yolk proportion in the oat-fed eggs. Fatty acid profile differences across treatments were not of nutritional significance, and no evidence was found that the feeding of hulless oats improved storage properties of eggs. In this study, modifying the carbohydrate source in layer diets was shown to change textural properties of cooked eggs in a way that was perceptible to untrained consumers, probably by reducing the yolk proportion. This finding was not commercially relevant owing to small effect size, and results overall add to existing evidence that hulless oats can be fed to poultry at a moderate proportion of the diet with no negative effect on consumer acceptability of eggs. Regardless of the small effect size, however, findings are interesting from the food chemistry perspective because they provide novel evid",229,99,1,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,337
"Fermentation and hydrothermal methods were tested to reduce the phytic acid (PA) content of oat bran, and the effects of these methods on the dietary fiber (DF) and total phenolic (TP) contents as well as the antioxidant activity (AA) were also investigated. Fermentation with 6% yeast and for 6 h resulted in 88.2% reduction in PA content, while it only resulted in 32.5% reduction in the sample incubated for 6 h without yeast addition. The PA loss in autoclaved oat bran sample (1.5 h, pH 4.0) was 95.2% while it was 41.8% at most in the sample autoclaved without pH adjustment. In both methods, soluble, insoluble, and total DF contents of samples were remarkably higher than the control samples.

"ScopeThe molecular mechanisms underlying the cholesterol-lowering properties of oats are only partly known. To study possible pathways involved, we investigated gene expressions in the liver and small intestine of mice fed oats. Method and resultsCholesterol and bile acids were analyzed in plasma and feces from LDL-receptor deficient (LDLr-/-) mice fed Western diet with wholegrain oats. A transcriptome analysis of mRNA from liver and jejunum was performed together with quantitative RT-PCR. Oat-fed mice had lower levels of plasma lipids and increased levels of bile acids and cholesterol in feces compared with controls. Two hundred thirty nine genes in jejunum and 25 genes in liver were differentially expressed (FDR corrected p < 0.05). The most affected biological process in jejunum was lipid biosynthesis and regulation. The apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT, Slc10a) and the intracellular bile acid binding protein (Fabp6) were both upregulated, whereas small heterodimer partner-1 (Shp-1) and apolipoprotein CII (Apoc2) were downregulated. ConclusionsWhole oats attenuated responses typically induced by high-fat diet.

"ScopeExposure biomarkers used for objective estimation of whole-grain (WG) intake are essential for epidemiologic studies of WG consumption, however, up to now, no exposure biomarkers were developed for WG oat intake. This study investigates the potential of oat unique components, Avenacoside-B (AVE-B) and -A (AVE-A), as exposure biomarkers of oat intake. Methods and resultsAn in vivo study performed in mice and an in vitro batch fecal fermentation study were used to investigate the potential metabolic routes of AVE-B and -A. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited in the human urinary pharmacokinetic study, each participant received a single dose of oat bran as breakfast, 48h urine samples were collected at baseline and after treatment period, and AVE-B and -A were quantified by LC-MS/MS. Deglycosylation metabolic route was identified as the major metabolic path for AVE-B and -A. Urinary AVE-B and -A concentrations increased rapidly after oat ingestion, reached their maximum excretion rates (ERmax) fairly simultaneously within 5h, then decreased gradually.

"Extrusion exposes flour components to high pressure and shear during processing, which may affect the dietary fiber fermentability by human fecal microbiota. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of flour moisture content during extrusion on in vitro fermentation properties of whole grain oats. Extrudates were processed at three moisture levels (15%, 18%, and 21%) at fixed screw speed (300 rpm) and temperature (130 degrees C). The extrudates were then subjected to in vitro digestion and fermentation. Extrusion moisture significantly affected water-extractable beta-glucan (WE-BG) in the extrudates, with samples processed at 15% moisture (lowest) and 21% moisture (highest) having the highest concentration of WE-BG. After the first 8 h of fermentation, more WE-BG remained in fermentation media in samples processed at 15% moisture compared with the other conditions. Also, extrusion moisture significantly affected the production of acetate, butyrate, and total SCFA by the microbiota during the first 8 h of fermentation. Microbiota grown on extrudates processed at 18% moisture had the highest production of acetate and total SCFA, whereas bacteria grown on extrudates processed at 15% and 18% moisture had the highest butyrate production. After 24 h of fermentation, samples processed at 15% moisture supported lower Bifidobacterium counts than those produced at other conditions, but had among the highest Lactobacillus counts. Thus, moisture content during extrusion significantly affects production of fermentation metabolites by the gut microbiota during the initial stages of fermentation, while also affecting probiotic bacteria counts during extended fermentation.",233,0,99,99,99,0,0,0,2,3,244
"Oat avenanthramides have long been known to possess potential nutraceutical and therapeutical properties. The change in avenanthramides 2p, 2c and 2f concentration in four salinity tolerant trans genic oat plants containing CBF3 gene and non-transgenic control exposed to different levels of salinity stress was investigated. Determination of oat avenanthramides at the nano-scale level was performed using a well-optimized and highly sensitive sequential injection chemiluminescence (SIA-CL) method enhanced by eco-friendly gold nanoparticles biosynthesized from oat biomass extract. Under the conditions of this study, the predominant avenanthramide, which also exhibited the strongest scavenging capacity, was 2c followed by 2p and 2f. At no stress, there was no significant (p < 0.05) difference between the transgenic lines and control regarding the concentrations of the three determined avenanthramides. After exposure to 250 mmol L-1 NaCI, avenanthramide 2c dramatically increased by 170.9%, 580%, 353.6%, 457.6% and 229.1% in the control and the four transgenic lines, respectively.

"Avenanthramides (AVNs), free and bound phenols and their antioxidant capacities (ORAC) were evaluated in two Avena sativa L. cultivars, Donata and Flavia. The cultivars (cvs.) were grown in loamy and medium texture soils and assessed after industrial dehulling and milling. Total dietary fiber, beta-glucan, starch and proteins were also evaluated. Cv. Donata showed 2.8 fold higher AVN storage as compared to cv. Flavia, which was linked with genotype. The accumulation of AVN content was also influenced by the texture of the soil. Dehulling resulted in a 75 and 37% AVN decrease in cv. Donata and Flavia, respectively. The dehulled grains of cv. Donata showed 40% reduction in free phenolic content, whereas the dehulled grains of both cvs. showed 67% reduction in bound phenols. Milling affected the bound phenolics and their antioxidant capacity. Cv. Flavia showed 1.3 fold higher beta-glucan than that of cv. Donata. Total dietary fiber was reduced by 50 and 12% after dehulling and milling, respectively, while marginal changes in proteins were observed after milling.

"Double cropping and increasing crop diversity could improve dairy farm economic and environmental sustainability. In this experiment, corn silage was partially replaced with 2 alternative forages, brown midrib-6 brachytic dwarf forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or fall-grown oat (Avena sativa) silage, in the diet of lactating dairy cows. We investigated the effect on dry matter (DM) intake, milk yield (MY), milk components and fatty acid profile, apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility, N utilization, enteric methane emissions, and income over feed cost. We analyzed the in situ DM and neutral detergent fiber disappearance of the alternative forages versus corn silage and alfalfa haylage. Sorghum was grown in the summer and harvested in the milk stage. Oats were grown in the fall and harvested in the boot stage. Compared with corn silage, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber concentrations were higher in the alternative forages. Lignin content was highest for sorghum silage and similar for corn silage and oat silage. The alternative forages had less than 1% starch compared with the approximately 35% starch in the corn silage. Ruminal in situ DM effective degradability was similar, although statistically different, for corn silage and oat silage, but lower for sorghum silage. Diets with the alternative forages were fed in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design experiment with three 28-d periods and 12 Holstein cows. The control diet contained 44% (DM basis) corn silage. In the other 2 diets, sorghum or oat silages were included at 10% of dietary DM, replacing corn silage. Sorghum silage inclusion decreased DM intake, MY, and milk protein content but increased milk fat and maintained energy-corrected MY similar to the control. Oat silage had no effect on DM intake, MY, or milk components compared to the control. The oat silage diet increased apparent total-tract digestibility of dietary nutrients, except starch, whereas the sorghum diet slightly decreased DM, organic matter, crude protein, and star",237,1,99,1,99,0,2,0,1,2,315
"A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) can be diversified by non-contaminated oats, but there is a shortage of long-term studies concerning its safety. We compared long-term treatment outcomes and factors associated with the introduction of oats between celiac patients on a GFD with or without oats. Eight hundred sixty-nine previously diagnosed celiac patients were interviewed. The validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB), and Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires were used to assess symptoms and quality of life, serological tests were performed, and results of histology were confirmed from patient records. We found the median duration of GFD to be 10 years and 82% using oats. Factors predicting the consumption of oats were diagnosis after the year 2000, advice from a dietitian, detection by screening, and mild clinical presentation. Oat consumers and non-consumers did not differ in dietary adherence (96.5% vs. 97.4%, p = 0.746), the prevalence of symptoms (22.9% vs. 22.5%, p = 0.931), positivity for endomysial antibodies (8.8% vs. 6.0%, p = 0.237), histological recovery after one year (63.1% vs. 60.0%, p = 0.773), malignancy (4.8% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.420), osteoporosis/osteopenia (9.2% vs. 11.0%, p = 0.489), or fractures (26.9% vs. 27.9%, p = 0.791).

The influence of thermal food processing on these toxins is poorly understood, and only a few publications address the degradation rates. Therefore, we systematically investigated the degradation of T-2 and HT-2 during both laboratory and industrial-scale extrusion cooking of oats. Extrusion cooking under. laboratory conditions was performed with oats fortified with T-2 or HT-2 as well as with naturally contaminated oat flour dust. The experiments were designed according to industrial conditions in terms of temperature, water content, pressure, residence time, and oat content.

"Oat is an excellent source of high-quality proteins. The protein content in cultivated oat is about 12% -15%. Oats with even higher protein contents would have great potential as a vegetative protein source. From a mutagenized oat population, 230 lines with seed protein levels of 15% or higher were identified from green house grown plants. Fifteen lines with protein levels ranging between 17 and 24% were chosen for further studies. The high protein character was confirmed by two consecutive propagations in the field. Crossings showed that the trait was stable and segregated in a Mendelian fashion. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the major increase was in globulin like proteins. In addition, total dietary fibre, 13-glucan and lipid levels were quantified. No correlation between any of these characters and the high protein trait could be found. Thousand Kernel Weight was also monitored and shown to be stable in the high protein lines. Thus, starting from the lines presented here a further development of commercial oat varieties with protein levels of 20% or higher is feasible. Such a high protein oat would be very important to meet the consumers need for high-quality high-protein oat for the food and feed industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the incorporation of oat beta-glucan (O beta G) on the hydration, rheological and fermentation properties of wheat flour dough. Wheat flour was substituted with O beta G at levels varying from 1 g/100 g-5 g/100 g. The addition of O beta G significantly increased water absorption and dough development time. The dilution effect of O beta G, competing for water and interaction between O beta G and gluten proteins, deteriorated the gluten network structure and reduced the stability of dough. Rheological evaluation revealed an increasing tendency to solid-like behavior with increasing addition of O beta G. Regarding dough fermentation properties, O beta G had no effect on yeast activity but reduced the gas retention capacity of dough. Our findings indicate that O beta G is a key component that determines the properties of dough, and excess O beta G exhibited poorer processing characteristics compared with control.

"Oats and groats can be discriminated from other grains such as barley, wheat, rye, and triticale (nonoats) with near-infrared spectroscopy. The two instruments tested herein were the manual version of the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service single-kernel near-infrared (SKNIR) instrument and the automated QualySense QSorter Explorer high-speed sorter, both used in similar near-infrared spectral ranges. Three linear discriminate self-prediction models were developed: 1) oats versus groats + nonoats, 2) oats + groats versus nonoats, and 3) groats versus nonoats. For all three models, the SKNIR instrument showed high correct classification of oats or groats (94.5-100%), which was similar to results of the QSorter Explorer at 95.0-99.4%. The amount of nonoats that were misclassified as oats or groats was low for both instruments at 0-0.2% for the SKNIR instrument and 0.8-3.7% for the QSorter Explorer. Linear discriminate models from independent prediction and validation sets yielded classification accuracies of 91.6-99.3% (SKNIR) and 90.5-97.8% (QSorter Explorer). Small differences in classification accuracy were attributed to processing speeds between the two instruments: 3 kernels/s for the SKNIR instrument and 35 kernels/s for the QSorter Explorer. This indicated that both instruments are useful for quantifying grain sample compositions of oat and groat samples and that both could be useful tools for meeting consumer demand for gluten-free or low-gluten products. Discrimination between grains will help producers and manufacturers meet various regulatory requirements. Examples include requirements such as those from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Commission of European Communities, in which gluten-free oats or other products can only be labeled as nongluten if they contain gluten at less than 20 ppm, the established safe consumption limit for people with celiac disease. The QSorter Explorer is currently being used to meet these requirements.",244,99,1,0,1,0,2,0,2,1,289
"Six Australian milling oat cultivars grown over two growing seasons were characterized for differences in (1,3)(1,4)-beta-glucan (beta-glucan) viscosity, solubility, molecular weight (M-w), and the effect of processing. Oat cultivars grown in 2012 had significantly higher extracted beta-glucan viscosity from oat flour than the same oat cultivar grown in 2011 (P < 0.05, mean 137 and 165 cP, respectively). Noodle beta-glucan mean viscosity for 2012 (147 cP) was significantly higher than for 2011 (128 cP). beta-Glucan from 'Williams' and 'Mitika' oats had the highest viscosity (P < 0.05) in flour (5.92 and 5.25%, respectively) and noodles (1.64 and 1.47%, respectively) for both years, compared with the other oat cultivars. beta-Glucan (M-w) of Williams for 2012 and 'Kojonup' for both years were the least affected by processing, with an average drop of 33% compared with a maximum of 63% for other cultivars. Therefore, Williams showed superior beta-glucan properties to other oat cultivars studied, and can potentially provide improved health benefits. High and low beta-glucan M-w populations were found in the same elution peak after processing. Oat cultivars chosen for processing should be those with Chi-glucans that are more resistant to processing, and that maintain their physiochemical properties and, therefore, bioactivity.",245,1,99,0,99,1,2,0,1,2,198
"A net postprandial glucose increment beyond 2 h has been shown to improve glucose and appetite regulation at a subsequent meal. Such an improved glycaemic profile (GP) has been reported for bread containing guar gum. In the present study three commercially available beta-glucans from barley and oat were baked into yeast leavened bread products. Only oat beta-glucan containing bread met the criteria of beta-glucan molecular weight and was included in a meal study. The three levels of oat beta-glucans reduced the GI and glucose iPeak by 32-37% compared to a white wheat reference bread. Furthermore, the highest oat beta-glucan level increased GP by 66% compared to the reference bread. It is concluded that the oat beta-glucans were suitable for use in baking, since the MW remained relatively high. Thus, the oat ingredient showed an interesting potential to be used when tailoring the glycaemic profile of bread products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",246,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,154
"This work aims to investigate the effects of fermentation with Monascus anka on the phenolic components and antioxidant activities of oats. Results revealed that the fermentation process significantly increased total phenolic content, especially free phenolic content. Moreover, the dominate phenolic compositions of free, conjugated and bound phenolic fractions from oats varied with fermentation. Both catechin in free phenolic fraction and ferulic acid in bound phenolic fraction were enhanced more than 100-fold, while the amount of newly generated rutin was up to 355.07 mg/kg in the conjugated fraction. All three phenolic fractions from fermented oats, especially the conjugated fraction, demonstrated greater DPPH and ABTS' radical scavenging abilities than that of unfermented oats. It was revealed that most of the phenolic compounds had a strong positive correlation with antioxidant activities. Consequently, fermentation may be a potential approach to improve oats' phenolic content and antioxidant capacity for functional foods in health promotion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"The commercial cellulose fibers and cellulose fibers extracted from rice and oat husks were analyzed by chemical composition, morphology, functional groups, crystallinity and thermal properties. The cellulose fibers from rice and oat husks were used to produce hydrogels with poly (vinyl alcohol). The fibers presented different structural, crystallinity, and thermal properties, depending on the cellulose source. The hydrogel from rice cellulose fibers had a network structure with a similar agglomeration sponge, with more homogeneous pores compared to the hydrogel from oat cellulose fibers. The hydrogels prepared from the cellulose extracted from rice and oat husks showed water absorption capacity of 141.6-392.1% and high opacity. The highest water absorption capacity and maximum stress the compression were presented by rice cellulose hydrogel at 25 degrees C. These results show that the use of agro-industrial residues is promising for the biomaterial field, especially in the preparation of hydrogels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background: Cardiovascular diseases are more prevalent and severe in Asian Indians. Simple diet-based strategies are important for prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of oats consumption on lipid parameters in mildly hypercholesterolemic Asian Indians living in India. Methods: A short-term, prospective, open-labeled, randomized controlled, parallel group study was conducted. Mildly hypercholesterolemic (total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL and < 240 mg/dL) subjects (n = 80) were randomized into two groups: intervention (n = 40) and usual diet (n = 40). Sample size was calculated for a two-group parallel superiority randomized control trial. Out of 80 enrolled subjects 69 subjects completed the study; 33 in the control group and 36 in the intervention group. In the intervention group, patients were served 70 g of oats twice a day in the form of porridge and upma (A thick porridge from oats with seasonings and vegetables) under observation at the study site. Lipid parameters were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention. Results: There was a reduction of 3.1% in total cholesterol levels in the control group as against 8.1% reduction in the intervention group (p < 0.02). Greater reductions were also seen in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the intervention group (11.6%) as compared to control group (4.1%, p < 0.04) over a period of 28 days. Conclusion: Daily consumption of 3 g of soluble fiber from 70 g of oats leads to beneficial effects on the lipid parameters, specifically total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic Asian Indians. Large scale studies over a longer period of intervention are required to further establish the cholesterollowering effect of oat fiber.",249,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,277
"The in vitro digestibility of oat starch and its relationship with starch molecular structure was investigated. The in vitro digestion results showed that the first-order kinetic constant (k) of oat starches (OS-1 and OS-2) was lower than that of rice starch. The size of amylose chains, amylose content and degree of branching (DB) of amylopectin in oat starch were significantly higher than the corresponding parameters in rice starch. The larger molecular size of oat starch may account for its lower digestion rate. The fine structure of amylopectin showed that oat starch had less chains of DP 6-12 and DP > 36, which may explain the small difference in digestion rate between oat and rice starch. The biosynthesis model from oat amylopectin fine structure data suggested a lower starch branching enzyme (SBE) activity and/or a higher starch synthase (SS) activity, which may decrease the DB of oat starch and increase its digestion rate.

"Warmer temperatures and increasing interest in high provenance food and drink products are creating new opportunities for cereal growing in northern Europe. Nevertheless, cultivation of oats and barley in these areas for malting and milling remains a challenge, primarily because of the weather, and there are few reports of their nutritional content from this region. In this study, trials in Orkney compared agronomic characteristics and nutritional content of recommended UK oat and barley varieties with Scandinavian varieties over three years. For a subset of varieties, nutritional content was compared with samples cultivated in more southerly sites. For Orkney, barley was considered a more suitable crop than oats because varieties matured earlier. In both crops, Scandinavian varieties matured earlier than UK varieties and some produced comparable yields. The range of values for macronutrients and minerals in oats and barley in Orkney were similar to those reported previously for other locations, but there were some significant differences attributable to variety and year. Compared with grain samples from more southerly locations, oats in Orkney had a significantly lower beta-glucan and higher sodium content. The lower P-glucan may have resulted from higher rainfall and lower temperatures during the months of grain filling and maturation. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Oat samples of different varieties were collected from various habitats for the determination of avenacoside, beta-glucan and fatty contents. The variation coefficients of the three components were 12.13%, 20.79% and 22.46%, respectively. Thus, those three indicators cannot represent the information of all samples, and are not suitable for evaluating the quality of oat raw materials and products. Fatty acid profiles were analyzed using gas chromatography combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. Fourteen leather oat varieties were distinguished through a PCA scores scatterplot. Forty-six naked oat varieties were selected by cluster analysis and eleven characteristic peaks in these naked oats were identified. Finally, accurate fatty acid standard fingerprints of naked oats were constructed. The results of methodological indicated high precision, reproducibility and stability, in line with fingerprint testing requirements. This study fills the knowledge gap for naked oat fingerprint information, expands the grain fatty acid database, and lays the foundations of a grain nutritional liposome identification technology system.

"Little research exists on Salmonella inactivation during extrusion processing, yet many outbreaks associated with low water activity foods since 2006 were linked to extruded foods. The aim of this research was to study Salmonella inactivation during extrusion of a model cereal product. Oat flour was inoculated with Salmonella enterica serovar Agona, an outbreak strain isolated from puffed cereals, and processed using a single-screw extruder at a feed rate of 75 kg/h and a screw speed of 500 rpm. Extrudate samples were collected from the barrel outlet in sterile bags and immediately cooled in an ice-water bath. Populations were determined using standard plate count methods or a modified most probable number when populations were low. Reductions in population were determined and analyzed using a general linear model. The regression model obtained for the response surface tested was Log (N-R/N-O) = 20.50 + 0.82T -141.16a(w) - .0039T(2) + 87.91a(w)(2) (R-2 = 0.69). The model showed significant (p < 0.05) linear and quadratic effects of a(w) and temperature and enabled an assessment of critical control parameters. Reductions of 0.67 +/- 0.14 to 7.34 +/- 0.02 log CFU/g were observed over ranges of a(w) (0.72 to 0.96) and temperature (65 to 100 degrees C) tested. Processing conditions above 82 degrees C and 0.89 a(w) achieved on average greater than a 5-log reduction of Salmonella. Results indicate that extrusion is an effective means for reducing Salmonella as most processes commonly employed to produce cereals and other low water activity foods exceed these parameters. Thus, contamination of an extruded food product would most likely occur postprocessing as a result of environmental contamination or through the addition of coatings and flavorings.",254,99,1,99,1,99,2,0,0,3,274
"Gluten derived from wheat and related triticeae cereals possesses distinct amino acid sequences that provoke the immunopathogenic features of celiac disease (CD) in genetically susceptible individuals. However, the role of oat-derived gluten, or avenins, in CD pathogenesis remains a disputed matter, as evidenced by a lack in harmonized legislation regarding gluten classification in relation to gluten-free labeling. In this study, we have analyzed a panel of pure oat cultivars using a sandwich ELISA based on the RS monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to canonical epitopes occurring within. celiagenic peptides present in triticeae-derived gluten but reportedly not present in avenins. We have identified three varieties of oats that reproducibly bind R5 antibodies and levels indicating the presence of gluten at more than the 20 ppm gluten regulatory threshold. Nested assessment using Western blot analysis and alternative gluten detection systems corroborated these results. Collectively, these data suggest that select oat varieties may prove problematic to patients with CD and to food companies and regulatory agencies and will extend our basic understanding of current gluten detection systems.",255,0,-1,-1,99,-1,0,3,1,1,174
"Whilst beers have been produced using various levels of unmalted grains as adjuncts along with malt, brewing with 100 % unmalted grains in combination with added mashing enzymes remains mostly unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the brewing potential of 100 % unmalted barley, wheat, oat and rye in comparison with 100 % malt. To address this, identical brewing methods were adopted at 10-L scale for each grain type by applying a commercial mashing enzyme blend (Ondea(A (R)) Pro), and selected quality attributes were assessed for respective worts and beers. Different compositions of fermentable wort carbohydrates were observed in the worts (all at ca. 12A degrees P), and in particular oat wort had lower concentration of maltose compared to the others, resulting in the lowest concentration of alcohol in final beer. Moreover, wort made from unmalted grains also showed lower free amino nitrogen and higher viscosity than malt wort. Furthermore, the use of 100 % unmalted grains resulted in a decrease in the levels of colour and brightness, as well as higher alcohols and esters in the final beers. Consequently, the study provides valuable information for exploring beer brewing with 100 % unmalted barley, oat, rye or wheat using exogenously added enzymes. It also helps to understand the process ability by revealing specific needs when manufacturing different type of beers from unmalted grains, potentially paving the way to process optimisation and development of future products.",256,99,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,5,238
"The objectives were to evaluate (1) the use of 2 types of experimental silos (S) to characterize whole-crop oat (Avena sativa L.) silage with or without addition of an inoculant (I), and (2) the effect of inoculation on the microbial community structure of oats ensiled using only plastic bucket silos (BKT). From each of 6 sections in a field, oats were harvested, treated (INO) or not (CON) with inoculant, packed into 19-L BKT or vacuum bags (BG), and ensiled for 217 d. The inoculant added contained Lactobacillus buchneri and Pediococcus pentosaceus (4 x 10(5) and 1 x 10(5) cfu/g of fresh oats, respectively). The experimental design was a complete randomized design replicated 6 times. Treatment design was the factorial combination of 2 S x 2 I. Some differences existed between BG versus BKT at silo opening (217 d), including a decreased CP (7.73 vs. 7.04 +/- 0.247% of DM) and ethanol (1.93 vs. 1.55 +/- 0.155) and increased lactic acid (4.28 vs. 3.65 +/- 0.241), respectively. Also, WSC and mold counts were reduced in BG versus BKT for CON (1.78 vs. 2.70 +/- 0.162% of DM and 0.8 vs. 2.82 +/- 0.409 log cfu/fresh g) but not for INO (similar to 1.53 and 1.55), respectively. Application of INO increased DM recovery (96.1 vs. 92.9 +/- 0.63%), aerobic stability (565 vs. 133 +/- 29.2 h), acetic acid (2.38 vs. 1.22 +/- 0.116% of DM), and reduced NDF (65.0 vs. 67.0 +/- 0.57), ADF (36.7 vs. 38.1 +/- 0.60), ethanol (0.63 vs. +/- 2.85 +/- 0.155), and yeast counts (1.10 vs. 4.13 +/- 0.484 log cfu/fresh g) in INO versus CON, respectively. At d 0, no differences were found for S and I on the nutritional composition and background microbial counts. Leuconostocaceae (82.9 +/- 4.27%) and Enterobacteriaceae (15.2 +/- 3.52) were the predominant bacterial families and unidentified sequences were predominant for fungi. A higher relative abundance of the Davidiellaceae fungal family (34.3 vs. 19.6 +/- 4.47) was observed in INO versus CON.

"Applications of soil amendments containing N are part of routine forage-management strategies for grasses, with a primary goal of increasing forage yield. However, the effects of N fertilization on forage nutritive value, estimates of energy density, and in vitro dry matter or neutral detergent fiber disappearance sometimes have been erratic or inconsistent. Our objectives were to evaluate the effects of N fertilization on the nutritive value of a single cultivar (ForagePlus, Kratz Farms, Slinger, WI) of fall-grown oat fertilized at planting with 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 kg of N/ha of urea or 2 rates of dairy slurry (42,300 or 84,600 L/ha). Nitrogen fertilization exhibited consistent effects on fiber components; forages fertilized with urea or dairy slurry had greater concentrations of fiber components compared with those harvested from unfertilized check plots (0 kg of N/ha), and fiber concentrations increased linearly with urea fertilization rate. In contrast, concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates were greatest for unfertilized forages (21.2%), but declined linearly with urea fertilization, exhibiting a minimum of 13.5% at the 80 kg of N/ha urea application rate. Similarly, nonfiber carbohydrates also declined linearly, from 34.8% for unfertilized check plots to a minimum of 24.6% at the 80 kg of N/ha urea application rate. Fertilization with urea resulted in consistent linear increases in crude protein (CP), neutral detergent soluble CP, neutral detergent insoluble CP, and acid detergent insoluble CP; however, the partitioning of CP oh the basis of association with specific fiber fractions could not be related to N fertilization when concentrations were expressed on a percentage of CP basis. The summative calculation of energy, expressed as total digestible nutrients was closely related to N fertilization rate during both the 2013 (y = -0.038x + 72.2; R-2 = 0.961) and 2014 (y = -0.040x + 69.2; R-2 = 0.771) production years.

"Gluten-free (GF) foods, whose claim compliance is controlled at the 'serving level', hold better chances of protecting gluten-intolerant consumers. This is particularly true for GF oatmeal, as oats are easily contaminated with gluten-rich kernels of wheat, rye and barley, which remain intact to the spoon as pill-like flakes. A single contaminant kernel in otherwise pure oats results in GF labelling noncompliance, thereby posing a risk to patients with coeliac disease. Our in-market survey of 965 GF oatmeal servings uncovered that one in fifty-seven servings exceeded the GF labelling maximum of 20 mg kg(-1) (i.e. 20 ppm). The noncompliance pattern was 'binary-like', with kernel-based contamination the suspected pass/fail driver. We have highlighted probabilities of misassessment for various sample sizes in light of oat's natural propensity for kernel-based contamination and proposed use of attribute-based sampling for compliance assessment, thereby providing a way to assess/manage/control 'rates of servings containing a contaminant kernel' within acceptable limits with high confidence.",259,99,-1,0,99,-1,0,2,1,2,155
"Oats are easily contaminated with gluten-rich kernels of wheat, rye and barley. These contaminants are like gluten 'pills', shown here to skew gluten analysis results. Using R-Biopharm R5 ELISA, we quantified gluten in gluten-free oatmeal servings from an in-market survey. For samples with a 5-20 ppm reading on a first test, replicate analyses provided results ranging <5 ppm to >160 ppm. This suggests sample grinding may inadequately disperse gluten to allow a single accurate gluten assessment. To ascertain this, and characterize the distribution of 0.25-g gluten test results for kernel contaminated oats, twelve 50 g samples of pure oats, each spiked with a wheat kernel, showed that 0.25 g test results followed log-normal-like distributions. With this, we estimate probabilities of mis-assessment for a 'single measure/sample' relative to the <20 ppm regulatory threshold, and derive an equation relating the probability of mis-assessment to sample average gluten content.

"Eggs contain high quality protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, yet regular consumption is still met with uncertainty. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of consuming two eggs per day or a heart-healthy oatmeal breakfast on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and satiety measures in a young, healthy population. Fifty subjects participated in a randomized crossover clinical intervention; subjects were randomly allocated to consume either two eggs or one packet of oatmeal per day for breakfast for four weeks. After a three-week washout period, participants were allocated to the alternative breakfast. Fasting blood samples were collected at the end of each intervention period to assess plasma lipids and plasma ghrelin. Subjects completed visual analog scales (VAS) concurrent to dietary records to assess satiety and hunger. Along with an increase in cholesterol intake, there were significant increases in both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol following the egg consumption period (p < 0.01). However, there was no difference in the LDL/HDL ratio, a recognized biomarker of CVD risk, nor in the plasma glucose, triglycerides or liver enzymes, between diet periods. Several self-reported satiety measures were increased following the consumption of eggs, which were associated with lower plasma ghrelin concentrations (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that compared to an oatmeal breakfast, two eggs per day do not adversely affect the biomarkers associated with CVD risk, but increase satiety throughout the day in a young healthy population.",261,1,99,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,242
"To investigate the effects of genotype and growing environment on avenanthramides and antioxidant activity of oats, the total phenolic content (TPC), avenanthramide compositions, and antioxidant activity were determined for whole oat from 39 cultivars grown in four locations in northwestern China (Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Shanxi and Gansu). The results demonstrated that environment (E), genotype (G) and the interaction of these factors (E x G) significantly affected TPC, concentration of avenanthramide 2c (2c, ranged from 6.24 to 136.20 mg kg(-1)), avenanthramide 2p (2p, 6.07-112.25 mg kg(-1)), avenanthramide 2f (2f, 7.26-222.77 mg kg(-1)) and antioxidant activity of oats. The effect of E was considerably greater than that of G or E x G. Based on G plus G x E interaction biplots (GGE biplots) analysis, the four locations in northwestern China can be divided into either two or three regions. Qinghai was determined to be distinct from the other locations. Cultivar Bayou 9 and oats grown in Gansu exhibited the highest TPCs, concentrations of 2c, 2p, 2f and antioxidant activity.

"A hyperspectral image analysis was used to characterize heat treatment in oat flour, performed by treating oat flour at 80,100 and 130 degrees C for 30 min. Images from both original oat and treated flours were captured, and hyperspectral information was collected. Oat flours were used to obtain composite flours based on two different substitution levels (10 and 20%) of wheat flour. Composite breads were produced from the obtained flours. A battery of analyses was run to characterize them in terms of physical properties. The hyperspectral information of oat flours was analyzed by multivariate statistics and a pattern evolution-depending temperature was observed. Similarly, a set of the physical properties of breads was analyzed based on multivariate statistics, and a pattern of temperature-dependent evolution, in addition to the substitution level, was also recognized. Multivariate non linear regressions were done between both data sets to study their relationship and high values in the calibration and cross-validation results obtained. The changes undergone by oat flour during treatment were characterized with hyperspectral information, which could represent a non destructive monitoring tool to then regulate it until oat flours are obtained that confer composite bread adequate properties.

The study results revealed that sprout oat seeds treated with ultraviolet, ultrasound, solution of antimicrobial drug of 3% and 5% concentration, succinic acid solution is not effective enough. Upon the organoleptic analysis of the resulting product, it is noted that organoleptic properties of the test product change when sprout seeds are treated with antimicrobial solution of more than 5% in concentration and with the potassium permanganate solution of more than 0.01% in concentration. The microbiological safety of sprout oat seeds is ensured without their organoleptic property changed when treated with 0.005% solution of potassium permanganate for four minutes or 0.1-0.5% solution of chitosan in succinic acid for 60 minutes.

"A survey was conducted to determine the concentration of Fusarium mycotoxins in UK oats over three seasons (2006-8). One hundred oat samples were collected each year at harvest, together with agronomic details, and analysed for 10 Fusarium mycotoxins. The incidence and concentration of most Fusarium mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol and zearalenone, were relatively low in oats compared with values previously reported for wheat. HT-2 toxin (HT2) and T-2 toxin (T2) levels were relatively high with an overall combined (HT2+T2) mean of 450 mu g kg(-1) for 2006-8. Data were combined with a previous dataset collected from 2002-5 to determine the effects of agronomic practices and climate. There was a negative relationship with late summer rainfall, indicating that drier conditions in July and August resulted in increased HT2 and T2 in UK oats. Agronomic factors that impacted upon HT2 and T2 in harvested oats were previous crop, cultivation, and variety. Analysis of the previous cropping history showed there was a stepwise increase in HT2+T2 as the cereal intensity of the rotation increased. Variety was an important factor, with higher levels and a wider range detected on winter versus spring varieties. Indicative levels for HT2 and T2 in cereals and cereal products were introduced by the EC in 2013. The indicative level for unprocessed oats for human consumption is a combined concentration (HT2 + T2) of 1000 mu g kg(-1).

"Starches isolated from eight oat cultivars were tested for their physicochemical, structural, and rheological properties. The isolated starches had low levels of ash and nitrogen contents with amylose ranging from 21.8 to 32.3 g/100 g. The amount of water released from starch gels decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with increase in freeze thaw cycle. The scanning electron micrographs revealed the presence of polygonal to irregularly shaped starch granules. All the starches exhibited A-type X-Ray diffraction pattern typically characteristic of cereal starches. The rheological properties of pastes were well described by the Herschel-Bulkley model at a shear rate of 0-100 s(-1) (R-2 > 0.99). The starch pastes behaved like a pseudoplastic fluid and exhibited shear thinning fluid characteristics with values of flow behaviour index considerably less than 1. Both the storage and loss moduli of the pastes increased sharply initially and then dropped after reaching the gelatinization peak. The magnitude of the dynamic rheological parameters varied significantly (p < 0.05) between the cultivars. All the starch pastes were highly elastic than viscous as evidenced by the lower tan values. Structure property relationships were established between starches using principal component analysis.",269,99,99,99,99,-1,0,1,0,4,189
"The cereal often dominates the grain legume in intercrops, especially when sown in larger amounts. This study assessed yield formation of pea (Pisum sativum L.) and oat (Avena sativa L.) in an intercropping system in high-latitude conditions. Three pea cultivars (Hulda, Karita and Perttu) and one oat cultivar (Roope) were grown as sole crops and intercrops with shares of either 7.5% or 15% of oat (as weight of sown seed mixture). Experiments were organized in three (southern, western and northern) locations of Finland for three years. Yield and vegetative above-ground biomass, their land equivalent ratio (LER, i.e., the yield in intercrop compared to that of the component yields in pure stands), and a number of yield components were measured prior to harvest at crop-stand and single-plant levels. The share of oat in the intercrop did not have any impact on variation in LERyield. Oat yield and yield components generally benefitted from a pea companion crop. The pea cultivar Perttu was superior in intercrops: it had a LERyield>1 in seven out of eight experiments (mean LERyield=1.06), while Karita had a LERyield>1 in four (mean LERyield=1.00) and Hulda only in one experiment (mean LERyield=0.98). Perttu proved to be a compatible pea companion for a pea-oat intercrop, likely because it was successful in overcompensating for decline in relative yield (RGY) of oat in intercrops, contrary to Hulda. However, none of the measured yield components of Perttu were associated with LERyield, suggesting compensation ability between them, while in Karita and Hulda, e.g., higher grain yield and number of grains and pods per square meter were associated with decline in LERyield. It was concluded that the success of Perttu as a companion for oat in intercrops is likely attributable to its flexibility in building yield through a variable combination of yield components rather than being outperformed due to some superior traits. Such flexibility, likely attributable to long duration of flowering supports resilience to weather vari",270,99,99,99,99,1,1,0,0,4,320
"Glutelins derived from oats were purified and hydrolyzed sequentially using alcalase proteases for production of antioxidant peptides. The antioxidant activities of oat glutelin peptides were evaluated using reducing power methods including hydroxyl and 1,1-diphenyl-2-pycrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging assays. The results demonstrated that oats glutelin peptide D-1a exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to the other hydrolysates. D-1a was identified to be His-Tyr-Asn-Ala-Pro-Ala-Leu (784.38Da) by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS).",271,1,99,1,99,1,3,0,0,2,68
"This study examined physical properties of grains from eight oat cultivars in relation to their techno-functional, pasting and antioxidant properties. All the cultivars differed significantly (P<0.05) in their physical parameters such as length, width, thickness, seed weight, seed volume, surface area and sphericity. The ash, fat, protein and fibre contents of the flours ranged from 0.84-3.54%, 2.027.27%, 6.12-13.33% and 0.21-0.84%, respectively. All the flours exhibited varied functional properties such as water absorption (4.0-7.24 g/g), oil absorption (3.15-6.28 g/g), Bulk density (0.511-0.610 g/ml) and gelation capacity (12-18%). The flours showed low foaming capacity but exhibited highly stable foams. The antioxidant activity of flours varied between 4.94-6.82% whereas the reducing power and total phenolic content was 1,131-1,463 mu g AAE/g and 1,688-2,016 mu g GAE/g. Pasting temperature, peak, breakdown and final viscosity of the flours ranged between 90.293.2 degrees C, 288620 mPa, 5094 mPa and 324939 mPa, respectively. The results of pasting parameters revealed that PLP-1 exhibited significantly (P<0.05) lowest peak, breakdown, trough, setback and final viscosities. Kent and PLP-1 were the most potential cultivars as they varied significantly (P<0.05) from other cultivars in their measured properties as shown by principal component analysis (PCA).

"Deoxynivalenol (DON) in cereals, produced by Fusarium fungi, cause poisoning in humans and animals. Fusarium infections in cereals are favoured by humid conditions. Host species are susceptible mainly during the anthesis stage. Infections are also positively correlated with a regional history of Fusarium infections, frequent cereal production and non-tillage field management practices. Here, previously developed process-based models based on relative air humidity, rain and temperature conditions, Fusarium sporulation, host phenology and mycelium growth in host tissue were adapted and tested on oats. Model outputs were used to calculate risk indices. Statistical multivariate models, where independent variables were constructed from weather data, were also developed. Regressions of the risk indices obtained against DON concentrations in field experiments on oats in Sweden and Norway 2012-14 had coefficient of determination values (R-2) between 0.84 and 0.88. Regressions of the same indices against DON concentrations in oat samples averaged for 11x11km grids in farmers' fields in Sweden 2012-14 resulted in R-2 values between 0.27 and 0.41 for randomly selected grids and between 0.31 and 0.62 for grids with average DON concentration above 1000gkg(-1) grain in the previous year. When data from all three years were evaluated together, a cross-validated statistical partial least squares model resulted in R-2=0.70 and a standard error of cross-validation (SECV)=522gkg(-1) grain for the period 1 April-28 August in the construction of independent variables and R-2=0.54 and SECV=647gkg(-1) grain for 1 April-23 June. Factors that were not accounted for in this study probably explain large parts of the variation in DON among samples and make further model development necessary before these models can be used practically. DON prediction in oats could potentially be improved by combining weather-based risk index outputs with agronomic factors.",273,99,1,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,282
"Objectives: A wild green-oats extract (Neuravena((R))) containing a range of potentially bioactive components, including flavonoids and triterpene saponins, has previously been shown to enhance animal stress responses and memory, and improve cognitive performance in humans at a dose of 1600 mg. Methods: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced cross-over study assessed the effects of single doses of the green-oat extract (GOE) across a broad range of cognitive domains in healthy adults aged 40-65 years who self-reported that they felt that their memory had declined with age. Participants attended on six occasions, receiving a single dose of either placebo, 800, or 1600 mg GOE on each occasion, with the counterbalanced order of treatments repeated twice for each participant. Cognitive function was assessed with a range of computerized tasks measuring attention, spatial/working/episodic memory, and executive function pre-dose and at 1, 2.5, 4, and 6 hours post-dose. Results: The results showed that 800mg GOE increased the speed of performance across post-dose assessments on a global measure including data from all of the timed tasks. It also improved performance of a delayed word recall task in terms of errors and an executive function task (Peg and Ball) in terms of decreased thinking time and overall completion time. Working memory span (Corsi blocks) was also increased, but only on the second occasion that this dose was taken. Discussion: These results confirm the acute cognitive effects of GOE seen in previous research, and suggest that the optimal dose lies at or below 800 mg.",274,1,1,0,1,99,3,0,1,1,246

"Whole grain oats, as a rich source of beta-glucan, have been shown beneficial to glycemic control. In the current study, the impact of native form beta-glucan in oat grains (NFO-glucan) on starch digestion and postprandial glycemia was investigated. The dry-milling prepared NFO-glucan sample was enriched with native form beta-glucan (15.6%), and an in vitro starch digestion assay of NFO-glucan (0.5% starch equivalent) showed a significant decrease of starch digestion rate compared to oat starch (0.5%, Aviv). However, pretreatment by either beta-glucanase or pepsin significantly increased the starch digestion. Consistently, an in vivo examination on the postprandial glycemia of the cooked NFO-glucan sample using a mouse model displayed a significant decrease of postprandial glycemia compared to gelatinized oat starch. Further experiment on the pasting property of NFO-glucan sample by a rapid visco-analyser demonstrated both beta-glucan and protein affected its viscosity profiles. Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM) observation revealed a network-like native structure of beta-glucan that might encapsulate protein and starch to reduce the enzyme accessibility and so the digestion of starch. Novel food processing technologies to maintain the native form of beta-glucan in oat grains might be a better way to modulate the postprandial glycemia of oat-based whole grain foods.

"Oat (Avena sativa L.) ranks seventh in the world cereal production and is considered to be an important source for many valuable components of nutritional and biological importance, i.e. proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibre, minerals and vitamins. Because of these properties the amount of oat used for human consumption has increased progressively during the last years. Unfortunately, the quality of this grain crop is often compromised by mycotoxin contamination, which is relatively ubiquitous despite efforts to control the problem. Therefore, it is important to investigate the distribution pattern of mycotoxins and their conjugated derivatives in contaminated oat grains. For this purpose we have developed a state-of-the-art multi-mycotoxin high-resolution mass spectrometry method and analysed oat samples for their content of the most important mycotoxins commonly occurring in Norwegian cereal grain. Quantitative mapping of selected Fusarium free and modified mycotoxins was performed in fractions collected during processing trials consisting of dehulling and sequential pearling. Both the derivative free mycotoxins and their metabolites were mainly present in the hulls compared to the oat kernel, thus dehulling resulted in a significant reduction of the total mycotoxin load, followed by some further reduction by pearling. Furthermore, free and modified mycotoxins were unevenly distributed in relation to each other throughout the grain fractions, showing a shift towards glucosidated forms, such as deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside and HT-2-3-glucoside in the oat kernel, which highlights potential food safety concerns associated with in planta modified mycotoxins.",277,1,-1,99,99,0,1,1,1,2,233
"The antiinflammatory activity of purified oat 1-3,1-4-beta-d-glucan against acute gastritis (sodium deoxycholate induced) model in rats was investigated as second part of experiment studying impact of oat beta-glucan on inflammatory states in gastrointestinal tract (first part was related to enteritis). 48 rats (Spraque-Dawley males, two groups - control and gastritis) were fed high and low molecular weights (MW) beta-glucan. Antioxidant defense parameters - SOD, TAS, GSH, GSSG and inflammation markers - TBARS, TNF-alpha, IL-10 and IL-12 were analyzed. Strong activity of both fractions was observed; high MW beta-glucan caused high TNF-alpha decrease in both experimental groups while low MW beta-glucan decreased the concentration of IL-10 in gastritis group. Both fractions significantly support innate antioxidant defense of stomach tissue not only in gastritis but in healthy state as well. The results reveal the potential therapeutic activity of purified oat beta-glucan in acidic environment of stomach at acute gastritis states. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Cold-set oat protein isolate (OPI) gels possessing a percolating network structure were successfully prepared using a glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) induced acidification method. The polymer-like percolating structures were established by active OPI monomers as small building block units through abundant cross-linking points. By increasing the GDL concentration, more intra-floc linkages and greater particle volume fractions were created at the supramolecular level, resulting in a dense rough gel wall with superior mechanical properties. In particular, at a 10% GDL content the gel was generated at the OPI isoelectric point (IEP). This OPI gel had a compact network structure with small pores and a thick wall, with an excellent water holding capacity (90%) and comparable mechanical strength (30 kPa) to egg white gel (22-32 kPa). Also, the cold-set OPI gels could resist acidic juice and pepsin digestion, which protected both a-amylase enzyme activity and the viability of probiotics in harsh gastric conditions. The in vitro release experiment demonstrated that OPI gels had the capacity to prevent the premature release of bioactive compounds in simulated gastric fluids, and yet still allowed their gradual release in a simulated intestinal environment where they normally would be absorbed. A convenient and non-toxic method to prepare OPI gels with superior performance has been described. These gels have the potential to act as delivery vehicles for sensitive compounds in food and non-food applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",279,99,1,99,1,1,3,0,0,2,230
"Sensory-directed fractionation of extracts prepared from oat flour (Avena sativa L.) followed by LC-TOF-MS, LCMS/MS, and 1D/2D-NMR experiments revealed avenanthramides and saponins as the key phytochemicals contributing to the typical astringent and bitter off-taste of oat. Besides avenacosides A and B, two previously unreported bitter-tasting bidesmosidic saponins were identified, namely, 3-(O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1 -> 2)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1 -> 3)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1 -> 4)]-beta-D-glucopyranosid)-26-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(25R)-furost-5-ene-3 beta,22,26-triol, and 3-(O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1 -> 2)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1 -> 4)]-beta-D-glucopyranosid)-26-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(25R)-furost-5-ene-3 beta,22,26-triol.

"While dietary fiber plays an important role in the health benefits associated with whole grain consumption, other ingredients concentrated in the outer bran layer, including alkylresorcinols, lignans, phenolic acids, phytosterols, and tocols, may also contribute to these outcomes. To determine the acute bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of the major phytochemicals found in barley and oats, we conducted a randomized, three-way crossover trial in 13 healthy subjects, aged 40-70 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 27-35.9 kg/m(2). After a two-day run-in period following a diet low in phytochemicals, subjects were randomized to receive muffins made with either 48 g whole oat flour, whole barley flour, or refined wheat flour plus cellulose (control), with a one-week washout period between each intervention. At the same time, an oral glucose tolerance test was administered. In addition to plasma phytochemical concentrations, glucose and insulin responses, biomarkers of antioxidant activity, lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and vascular remodeling were determined over a 24-h period. There was no significant effect on acute bioavailability or pharmacokinetics of major phytochemicals. Administered concurrently with a glucose bolus, the source of whole grains did not attenuate the post-prandial response of markers of glucoregulation and insulin sensitivity, inflammation, nor vascular remodeling compared to the refined grain control. No significant differences were observed in the bioavailability or postprandial effects between whole-oat and whole-barley compared to a refined wheat control when administered with a glucose challenge. These null results may be due, in part, to the inclusion criteria for the subjects, dose of the whole grains, and concurrent acute administration of the whole grains with the glucose bolus.",281,1,0,0,1,1,3,0,2,0,263
"Whole oat flour (WOF) is known for high -glucan and antioxidant content. The main purpose of this study was to replace white wheat flour with WOF at different levels of 0, 10, 20 and 30% in production of bread using part-baking technology. Dough properties (using farinograph) and physical characteristics of full-baked breads stored for 1 h and 72 h at 20C were studied. Increases in water absorption, dough development time and dough softening, while a reduction in dough stability time with addition of WOF were obsereved. The specific volume of fresh breads containing WOF reduced further after storage. The crumb hardness, chewiness, elasticity and cohesiveness reduced and crust color became lighter with addition of WOF and storage time. The effects of bread storage were more obvious for samples containing WOF. The bread containing 10% WOF received the highest sensory scores and had similar sensory characteristics to the control. Practical ApplicationsCostumer demand for breads with health benefits and superior sensory properties is increasing rapidly. This study showed the effects of substitution white wheat flour with whole oat flour (WOF) which is well-known for its health benefits owing to considerable amount of -glucan and antioxidants. The results of this study are applicable in bakery industry and specifically in production of bread using part-baked technology and can be useful for the producers of functional and healthy products. Some of the effects of flour replacement with 0, 10, 20 and 30% WOF were undesirable and had negative effects on sensory attibutes of the full-baked breads. The adverse effects of storage (72 h at ambient temparature) were more obvious for breads containing WOF. However, inclusion of 10% WOF resulted in a bread with similar sensory properties to the control and hence it can be used succesfully for production of a healthier part-baked bread.",282,99,99,1,0,1,2,0,1,2,298
"Fiber-enriched chicken meat biscuits incorporated with wheat bran and oat bran at three different levels i.e., 3% (W1/O1), 5.0% (W2/O2) and 7% (W3/O3) were formulated and evaluated. On the basis of sensory quality from each group, W2 and O2 were selected for storage study at ambient temperature for 180 days. The bran incorporation resulted in a significant lowering (P<0.05) in the pH values, fat content, water activity and calorific values whereas moisture content, ash and crude fiber content of treatment recorded an increased trend. Bran treated samples were found with improved oxidative stability as measured by free fatty acids and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value during storage. Treated biscuits were recorded with significantly (P<0.05) lower pH value and higher water activity during entire storage. Oat bran incorporated chicken meat biscuit were found to better maintained sensory characteristics than wheat bran incorporated meat biscuits and control throughout the storage study. Practical ApplicationsBiscuits are generally cereal based snacks, lacking in essential amino acids and dietary fiber. The incorporation of meat and brans would increase its nutritive and functional value as well as keeping quality. It also partially fulfills the dietary requirement of dietary fiber.",283,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,192
"The Fusarium mycotoxins HT-2 toxin (HT2) and T-2 toxin (T2) are frequent contaminants in oats. These toxins, but also their plant metabolites, may contribute to toxicological effects. This work describes the use of C-13-assisted liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry for the first comprehensive study on the biotransformation of HT2 and T2 in oats. Using this approach, 16 HT2 and 17 T2 metabolites were annotated including novel glycosylated and hydroxylated forms of the toxins, hydrolysis products, and conjugates with acetic acid, putative malic acid, malonic acid, and ferulic acid. Further targeted quantitative analysis was performed to study toxin metabolism over time, as well as toxin and conjugate mobility within non-treated plant tissues. As a result, HT2-3-O-beta-D-glucoside was identified as the major detoxification product of both parent toxins, which was rapidly formed ( to an extent of 74% in HT2-treated and 48% in T2-treated oats within one day after treatment) and further metabolised. Mobility of the parent toxins appeared to be negligible, while HT2-3-O-beta-D-glucoside was partly transported ( up to approximately 4%) through panicle side branches and stem. Our findings demonstrate that the presented combination of untargeted and targeted analysis is well suited for the comprehensive elucidation of mycotoxin metabolism in plants.",284,0,99,0,-1,0,0,1,3,1,199
"The purpose of this study was to determine, for the first time, antioxidant activities of seven peptides (P1-P7) derived from hydrolysis of oat proteins in a cellular model. In the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, it was found that P2 had the highest radical scavenging activity (0.67 +/- 0.02 mu M Trolox equivalent (TE)/mu M peptide) followed by P5, P3, P6, P4, P1, and P7 whose activities were between 0.14-0.61 mu M TE/mu M). In the hepatic HepG2 cells, none of the peptides was cytotoxic at 20-300 mu M. In addition to having the highest ORAC value, P2 was also the most protective (29% increase in cell viability) against 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)dihydrochloride -induced oxidative stress. P1, P6, and P7 protected at a lesser extent, with an 8%-21% increase viability of cells.

"Background & aims: We aimed to determine the impact of serving size and addition of sucrose on the glycemic response elicited by oatmeal. Methods: We studied 38 healthy subjects (mean +/- SD age 40 +/- 12 yr, BMI 26.4 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2)) on 8 separate days using a randomized, cross-over design. Capillary blood-glucose responses over 2hr after consuming 30, 40 and 60 g Classic Quaker Quick Oats (18, 24 and 36 g available-carbohydrate [avCHO], respectively) and 30 g Oats plus 9 g sucrose (27 g avCHO) were compared with those after avCHO-matched servings of Cream of Rice cereal (Control) (22, 29, 44 and 33 g cereal, respectively). Blood-glucose incremental area under the curve (iAUC), peak-rise, rate-of-decline, time-to-peak and time-to-baseline were calculated. Results: As serving size increased, iAUC, peak-rise, rate-of-decline and time-to-baseline increased significantly for both cereals, but the rate of increase was significantly greater for Control than for Oats. Time-to-peak increased significantly with serving size only for Oats. Compared to avCHO-matched servings of Control, mean (95% CI) iAUC, peak-rise and rate-of-decline, respectively were 22 (16, 27)%, 22 (19, 26)% and 23 (18, 27)% lower after consuming Oats without sucrose and 26 (18, 34)%, 14 (9, 20)% and 16 (9, 24)% lower after consuming Oats plus sucrose. Conclusions: Oatmeal elicited a significantly lower glycemic response than avCHO-matched servings of Cream of Rice, even when sucrose was added to the oatmeal. Measures of glycemic response tended to increase with increased serving size; although the pattern of change varied between cereal types. These results suggest that oatmeal may be a good choice for minimizing postprandial glycemia. Clinical trial registry: ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02506972).

Morphology of the oat starches changed into a continuous network with increased values for onset temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp), and conclusion temperature (Tc). XRD showed an additional peak at 13 degrees and increase in peak intensity at 20 degrees inclusive of the major X-ray diffraction peaks which reflects formation of amylose-lipid complex from dual autoclaving-retrogradation cycle. Peaks at 13 degrees and 20 degrees are the typical peaks of the V-type pattern.

"This study investigated the profiles of volatile compounds produced by Lactobacillus paracasei during oat fermentation using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with headspace solid-phase microextraction method. A total of 60 compounds, including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, furan derivatives, hydrocarbons, ketones, sulfur-containing compounds, terpenes, and other compounds, were identified in fermented oat. Lipid oxidation products such as 2-pentylfuran, 1-octen-3-ol, hexanal, and nonanal were found to be the main contributors to oat samples fermented by L. paracasei with the level of 2-pentylfuran being the highest. In addition, the contents of ketones, alcohols, acids, and furan derivatives in the oat samples consistently increased with the fermentation time. On the other hand, the contents of degradation products of amino acids, such as 3-methylbutanal, benzaldehyde, acetophenone, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide, decreased in oat samples during fermentation. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to discriminate the fermented oat samples according to different fermentation times. The fermented oats were clearly differentiated on PCA plots. The initial fermentation stage was mainly affected by aldehydes, whereas the later samples of fermented oats were strongly associated with acids, alcohols, furan derivatives, and ketones. The application of PCA to data of the volatile profiles revealed that the oat samples fermented by L. paracasei could be distinguished according to fermentation time.",288,0,99,0,99,0,0,0,3,2,209
"In the present study, 15 dehulled and 15 naked oats were used for a comparative analysis of macronutrients, beta-glucan, free (FPs) and bound (BPs) polyphenols and avenanthramides (AVNs). The naked and dehulled oat cultivar samples (cvs.) did not show any significant difference in protein and lipid percentages and only small differences in starch. As regard the beta-glucan, no significant difference in the average values between naked and dehulled cvs. was observed. Concerning polyphenols, BPs showed higher levels than FPs, but the antioxidant capacity (ORAC) of the FPs was superior to that of the BPs. Naked oats showed a concentration of AVN that was three fold higher than that of dehulled oats. Regarding the storage, AVNs resulted to be the most sensitive non-caloric nutrients to storage conditions, as a depletion was detected in most of the analyzed cvs. Overall, our results suggested that there is a great variability, in term of AVN content, between naked and dehulled oat cvs. and that storage conditions must be adapted for groups of cvs. in order to reduce their loss. Moreover, high levels of 13-glucan found in some cvs. may help us to develop commodities, which meet the EFSA requirements for health claims. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Globulin, albumin, gluten, and gliadin in oat bran were prepared by the Osborn method using oat bran as starting material. We characterized the secondary and tertiary structures of 4 proteins using circular dichroism, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy in order to analyze the composition and functional mechanisms. The results showed that the amino acid composition in all the 4 proteins was relatively balanced, and the essential amino acid content in albumin and globulin was high. The molecular weights of albumin, globulin, gliadin, and gluten were 19 to 21, 15 to 53, 20 to 38, and 10 to 90 kDa, respectively. The composition of gluten was a little complex compared to those of the other oat bran proteins. The secondary structure distribution of the 4 proteins differed, and increase in the pH resulted in modification of the -sheet structure to -helical structure. Moreover, the -helix content and surface hydrophobicity were negatively correlated (r = -0.988, P < 0.05). The peak position ((max)) and intensity of the fluorescence spectra of 4 proteins were in the order of gliadin > globulin > gluten > albumin, indicating that surface hydrophobicity of gliadin was the strongest and that of albumin was the weakest among the 4 proteins.",290,0,1,1,99,0,2,0,2,1,203
"Specific structures of oat and barley beta(1,3)(1,4)-glucans induced different in vitro immunomodulatory effects in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from TLR2/4 knock out mice. All barley beta-glucan fractions induced larger amounts of cytokines in BMDCs than their oat equivalents. The particulate fractions of both glucans induced high amounts of cytokines, especially after sample homogenisation. The small particulate barley beta-glucan induced more cytokines than the equivalent oat fraction, hence there are more features influencing the immunomodulatory properties of beta-glucans than only the particle size. The soluble glucan fraction and heated suspension induced only low amounts of cytokines, but were different for the two beta-glucans, indicating that molecular specificity matters for immunomodulation. Immunomodulatory activity is influenced by the insolubility of beta-glucans, to which characteristics as particle size, granule conformation and particulate homogeneity are related.

Pigs were fed a standard diet or a diet containing twice the beta-glucan content for 3 days (n = 5 per group), followed by the collection of small intestinal mucus and tissue samples. Samples of the consumed diets were subjected to in vitro digestion to determine beta-glucan release, nutrient profile and assessment of mucus permeability. In vitro digestion of the diets indicated that 90% of the beta-glucan was released in the proximal small intestine. Measurements of intestinal mucus showed a reduction in permeability to 100 nm latex beads and also lipid from the digested enhanced beta-glucan diet. The data from this study show for the first time that reducing mass transfer of bile and lipid through the intestinal mucus layer may be one way in which this decrease in bile re absorption by soluble fibre is enabled.

"Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) were extracted from cold-acclimated oat by vacuum infiltration-centrifugation. Ammonium precipitation, ion exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography were used successively to purify the oat AFPs (AsAFPs), and the proteins were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that an ammonium-sulfate saturation of 50-100 % was optimal for supernatant precipitation. After purification, AsAFP was found to have achieved an electrophoretic purity and its thermal-hysteresis activity was measured at 1.24 A degrees C (15 mg ml(-1)). The mass fingerprinting and sequencing results indicated the homology of AsAFP and endochitinase. Recrystallization and melting resistance of ice cream were improved by AsAFP (0.1 %). Moreover, the addition of AsAFP (0.1 %) in ice cream increased the glass transition temperature (Tg) from -29.14 to -27.74 A degrees C.",293,99,99,99,99,1,1,0,0,4,131
"Barley flakes contain higher levels of soluble fiber than oatmeal and can be prepared in a similar manner, giving barley greater satiating and disease reduction potential than oatmeal. However, barley is not commonly consumed as a breakfast cereal, and it is unknown if consumers would accept barley as an oatmeal substitute or how much satiating potential barley offers versus oatmeal. To examine these questions, subjects were enrolled in a crossover study, consuming two meals at least one week apart that were identical except for being served either barley or oatmeal as a breakfast cereal. Subjects came in during breakfast hours after an overnight fast and rated the sensory characteristics of the cereals, both plain and with preferred toppings added. Subjects rated satiety on a visual analog scale before and after consuming the cereal and every half hour during the 4 hr fast that followed and then recorded their next meal. We found no evidence of a difference in preference for sensory characteristics between the barley and oatmeal cereals. Subjects consumed 13% more cereal and toppings during the oatmeal consumption visits compared to barley. Satiety measurements displayed minimal differences at baseline and showed no difference over the 4 hr postconsumption fast. However, approximately 90 more calories were consumed during the postfast meal after consumption of oatmeal than after consumption of barley.",294,0,-1,1,99,-1,1,2,1,1,220
"The aim of this study was to evaluate metal binding and antioxidant activities of hydrolyzed oat bran proteins followed by the determination of peptide sequences. Protamex oat bran protein hydrolysates (OBPH) were separated by reverse-phase HPLC into eight peptide fractions (F1-F8) and their abilities to either chelate metals (Fe2+, Ca2+) or prevent the oxidation of lipids were investigated. In the Fe2+ chelation assay, OBPH had significantly (p < 0.05) higher activity (39.7 %) than the best performed fraction F7 (22.8 %). The second most active was F5 with 12.1 % chelating activity and this was higher than the activity of the tripeptide glutathione (5.8 %) used as control. The two most Fe2+ chelating fractions (F5, F7) however had weak calcium binding (0.6-1.0 %) properties at peptide concentration ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 mg/mL. In the lipid peroxidation assay, OBPH and all HPLC fractions prevented the oxidation of linoleic acid. More than 60 peptides mainly derived from globulin and avenin proteins were identified using tandem mass spectrometry.",295,1,99,0,1,0,2,0,2,1,166
"Glycemic control and weight reduction are primary goals for the management of overweight and obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Effective management cannot be achieved without an appropriate diet. Our study aimed to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of oat intake and develop a reasonable dietary plan for overweight T2DM patients. A randomized control trial, registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (Identification code: NCT01495052), was carried out among adult T2DM patients. A subgroup of 298 overweight subjects was selected and received a 30-day centralized intervention and 1-year free-living follow-up. Participants were randomly allocated to one of the following four groups. The usual care group (n = 60) received no intervention; the healthy diet group (n = 79) received a low-fat and high-fiber diet (healthy diet); the 50 g-oats group (n = 80) and 100 g-oats group (n = 79) received the healthy diet with the same amount of cereals replaced by 50 g and 100 g oats respectively. Anthropometric, blood glycemic and lipid variables were measured. For the 30-day intervention, significant differences in the changes of FPG (fasting plasma glucose), PPG (postprandial plasma glucose), HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin), HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), TC (total cholesterol), TG (total triglycerides), and LDL-c (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were observed among the four groups. Compared to the healthy diet group, the 50 g-oats group had a bigger reduction in PPG (mean difference (MD): -1.04 mmol/L; 95% CI: -2.03, -0.05) and TC (MD: -0.24 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.47, -0.01); the 100 g-oats group had a bigger reduction in PPG (MD: -1.48 mmol/L; 95% CI: -2.57, -0.39), HOMA-IR (MD: -1.77 mU<bold>mol</bold>/L-2; 95% CI: -3.49, -0.05), TC (MD: -0.33 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.56, -0.10) and LDL-c (MD: -0.22 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.41, -0.03).

"Background: Viscous dietary fibers including oat -glucan are one of the most effective classes of functional food ingredients for reducing postprandial blood glucose. The mechanism of action is thought to be via an increase in viscosity of the stomach contents that delays gastric emptying and reduces mixing of food with digestive enzymes, which, in turn, retards glucose absorption. Previous studies suggest that taking viscous fibers separate from a meal may not be effective in reducing postprandial glycemia. Methods: We aimed to re-assess the effect of consuming a preload of a commercially available oat-bran (4.5, 13.6 or 27.3 g) containing 22% of high molecular weight oat -glucan (O22 (OatWell((R))22)) mixed in water before a test-meal of white bread on glycemic responses in 10 healthy humans. Results: We found a significant effect of dose on blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) (p = 0.006) with AUC after 27.3 g of O22 being significantly lower than white bread only. Linear regression analysis showed that each gram of oat -glucan reduced glucose AUC by 4.35% +/- 1.20% (r = 0.507, p = 0.0008, n = 40) and peak rise by 6.57% +/- 1.49% (r = 0.582, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: These data suggest the use of oat bran as nutritional preload strategy in the management of postprandial glycemia.",297,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,215
"The study is aimed at studying the effects of soluble and insoluble oat -glucan on colon carcinogenesis in mice. One hundred and twenty male Kunming mice were divided into normal control (NC), model control (MC), high doses (100mg/kg body weight) of soluble (H-SOG) and insoluble -glucan (H-IOG), and low doses (50mg/kg body weight) of soluble (L-SOG) and insoluble -glucan (L-IOG) groups. The mice except those in the NC group were given subcutaneous injections of DMH to induce colon cancer. The bile acid content was significantly reduced but the colonic short-chain fatty acid content was enhanced (p<.05) in mice administered -glucan, moreover, the tumor cells apoptosis was significantly promoted (p<.05), compared to the MC group. The effect of high doses -glucan was better than the low doses, but there is little difference between the SOG and IOG. Results suggested that both SOG and IOG exert favorable effects in preventing colon cancer in a doses-dependent manner while the specific mechanism maybe different.",298,1,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,160
"BACKGROUNDOat is considered as a moderately salt-tolerant crop that could be used to improve saline and alkaline soil. Previous studies have focused on short-term salt stress exposure (0.5-48h), while molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in oat remain unclear. RESULTSLong-term salt stress (16days) increased the levels of superoxide dismutase activity, peroxidase activity, malondialdehyde content, putrescine content, spermidine content and soluble sugar content and reduced catalase activity in oat roots. The stress also caused changes in protein profiles in the roots. At least 1400 reproducible protein spots were identified in a two-dimensional electrophoresis gel, among which 23 were differentially expressed between treated vs control plants and 13 were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. CONCLUSIONThese differentially expressed proteins are involved in five types of biological process: (1) two fructose-bisphosphate aldolases, four alcohol dehydrogenases, an enolase, a UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase and an F1-ATPase alpha subunit related to carbohydrate and energy metabolism; (2) a choline monooxygenase related to stress and defense; (3) a lipase related to fat metabolism; (4) a polyubiquitin related to protein degradation; (5) a 14-3-3 protein related to signaling.

"The objective of the present study was to characterize the consumption of cooked oatmeal in the United States (U.S.) and to determine whether oatmeal consumption is associated with body mass index (BMI). To estimate current intakes of cooked oatmeal in the various age and gender population groups, we used dietary intake data from Day 1 of the U.S. 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). We also used dietary intake data from Day 1 of the U.S. 2003-2012 NHANES to assess associations between intakes of cooked oatmeal (in g/kg body weight) and NHANES cycle (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012), age category (3-11 years, 12-18 years, 19-44 years, 45 years+), gender, and BMI classification (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese), using a multiple linear regression model. A consumer of oatmeal was defined as any individual who reported the consumption of any amount of oatmeal on Day 1 of the survey. Approximately 6% of the total population consumed oatmeal, with an average intake of 238 g/day of cooked oatmeal among consumers. The greatest prevalence of oatmeal consumption was in infants (14.3%) and older female adults (11.1%). Amongst oatmeal consumers, underweight, normal weight, and overweight individuals consumed significantly more oatmeal than obese individuals. Oatmeal was consumed almost exclusively at breakfast and, among consumers, contributed an average of 54.3% of the energy consumed at breakfast across all age groups examined. The association between oatmeal consumption and BMI is interesting and requires confirmation in future clinical studies.",300,1,1,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,245
"While much is known about the benefits of oat fiber, the relevance of phenolics from oat based food products remains unclear. To gain insight into the relevance of phenolics from consumer oat products, the content of phenolics and avenanthramides (AVEs) was followed in 10 oat cultivars as well as milled oat ingredients and ready to eat (RTE) consumer products (puffed cereals and snack bars). Free phenolic content ranged from 17.2 to 228.1 mu g g(-1) DW with AVEs accounting for 57.3-90.6% of the total free phenolics. Bound phenolic content ranged from 141.4 to 680.9 mu g g(-1) DW with ferulic acid accounting for 62-94% of the bound phenolics. Select oat groats were ground to flour and prepared as wet cooked porridges (similar to 20% oat flour in boiling water) or introduced as RTE products into a three stage in vitro digestion to determine phenolic bioaccessibility. The relative bioaccessibility for wet cooked porridges ranged from 0.3-2.6% and from 2.9-28.8% for individual phenolic acids and AVEs, respectively. Puffed oat cereal had significantly higher bioaccessibility compared to matching wet-cook porridge made from the same oat flour (e.g. 83.8% versus 19.1% for AVE A; p < 0.05). Intestinal uptake of bioaccessible oat phenolics from digesta was confirmed by experiments with Caco-2 human intestinal cells. The overall intestinal uptake of oat phenolics was low, ranging between 0.16% and 2.71% across digesta from all oat products. In conclusion, these experiments demonstrate that phenolics naturally present in whole grain oats are recovered well through traditional grain processing, milling and food processing. Furthermore, processing of oat cultivars into a RTE cereal may have a positive impact on the digestive release and bioaccessibility of oat phenolics in the upper GI tract.",301,1,0,1,99,0,2,0,2,1,282
"Three oat products were supplemented into high fat diets and fed to obese rats for 8 weeks. Each oat product decreased body weight, epididymal fat accumulation, and serum inflammatory factor levels and significantly regulated serum lipid levels. Oat bran significantly reduced mean adipocyte size and TNF-alpha mRNA expression levels. Principal components analysis showed that the oat products shifted the overall structure of gut microbiota in DIO rats. The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio were altered towards that of normal rats. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that changes in the overall microbiota composition were significantly correlated with total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, endotoxin, and tumour cell necrosis factor-alpha levels in serum, and mRNA expression levels. Oat products significantly increased the total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration in colonic digesta. These results suggest that oat products attenuate obesity and related metabolic disorders while modifying the gut microbiota composition in high fat diet-induced obese rats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Several food regulatory agencies around the world have approved health claims for oat-derived beta-glucan for cholesterol lowering and glycemic control. The biological efficacy of beta-glucan appears to depend both on daily intake and on physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight and viscosity. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of oat processing, genotype, and growing location on the physicochemical properties of beta-glucan. Five oat genotypes (HiFi, Leggett, CDC Dancer, Marion, and CDC Morrison) grown in two locations (Saskatoon and Kernen) were dehulled (untreated) and processed in a pilot facility through kilning (kilned, not flaked) and subsequent steaming and flaking (kilned, flaked). Untreated groats gave a relatively low Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) apparent viscosity (164 cP) and a low extractable beta-glucan molecular weight (332,440) but exhibited high beta-glucan solubility (90.49%). Compared with untreated groats, the kilned (not flaked) samples had significantly increased RVA apparent viscosity (314 cP) and extractable beta-glucan molecular weight (604,710). Additional processing into kilned and flaked products further increased RVA apparent viscosity (931 cP) and beta-glucan molecular weight (1,221,760), but beta-glucan solubility (63.83%) was significantly reduced. Genotype and growing environment also significantly affected beta-glucan viscosity and molecular weight, but no significant interaction effects between processing, genotype, and environment were found. Results indicate that there is potential for processors to improve the physicochemical and nutritional properties of oat end products through processing of specific oat genotypes from selected growing locations.",303,0,1,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,234
"with increasing syrup concentration, depending on material and syrup concentration. The maximum values of oat flour and starch paste viscosity were achieved at 30-40% syrup concentration, and at 50% for wheat pastes. Oat flour and starch pastes were pseudoplastic shear thinning fluids. In presence of syrup they revealed lesser deviation from Newtonian properties. Mechanical spectrum analysis of oat flour and starch pastes revealed stronger elastic than viscous properties. The hardness of flour gels prepared in syrup was higher than aqueous ones, and was increasing with increasing syrup concentration. It was stable during 7 days of storage. Adhesiveness of oat flour gels with syrup were lower than aqueous ones, reverse situation was observed for wheat flour gels.

"Whole grain oat flour was extruded under different moisture contents (15%, 18%, 21%), barrel temperatures (100 degrees C, 130 degrees C), and screw speeds (160 rpm, 300 rpm, 450 rpm), and selected physicochemical properties, in vitro starch digestibility, and beta-glucan extractability of the extrudates were analyzed. An increase in screw speed resulted in an increase in radial expansion index, water absorption index, and water solubility index. Screw speed significantly affected slowly and rapidly digestible starch. Moderate screw speed (300 rpm) led to higher slowly digestible starch with an accompanying decrease in rapidly digestible starch. Low moisture conditions (15%) resulted in the highest resistant starch and water-extractable beta-glucan. Under the conditions used in this study, extrusion did not result in changes in water-extractable beta-glucan molecular weight. Thus, extrusion might be beneficial in improving functionality and consumer acceptability by affecting physicochemical properties, in vitro starch digestibility, and beta-glucan extractability of oat extrudates.

"Diabetes-specific nutritional formulas (DSNFs) are frequently used as part of medical nutrition therapy for patients with diabetes. This study aims to evaluate postprandial (PP) effects of 2 DSNFs; Glucerna (GL) and Ultra Glucose Control (UGC) versus oatmeal (OM) on glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides (TG). After an overnight fast, 22 overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes were given 200 kcal of each of the three meals on three separate days in random order. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min. Glucose area under the curve (AUC(0-240)) after GL and UGC was lower than OM (p < 0.001 for both). Insulin positive AUC(0-120) after UGC was higher than after OM (p = 0.02). GLP-1 AUC(0-120) and AUC(0-240) after GL and UGC was higher than after OM (p < 0.001 for both). FFA and TG levels were not different between meals. Intake of DSNFs improves PP glucose for 4 h in comparison to oatmeal of similar caloric level. This is achieved by either direct stimulation of insulin secretion or indirectly by stimulating GLP-1 secretion.

"In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the evaluating Member State (EMS), France, received an application from Syngenta Crop Protection AG to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance cyproconazole in pulses, barley and oat. According to EFSA, the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0.08 mg/kg for pulses, and 0.2 mg/kg for barley and oat grain. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of cyproconazole on the commodities under consideration.

"Cereal products are a main source of carbohydrates in the human diet. Barley and oat grains are considered as functional ingredients that can manipulate postprandial glycemic load while legume material provides high fiber and protein components to food. This research reports on hot extrusion (barrel temperature: 81.9103.6C, die temperature: 57.3-77.3C and screw speed was around 200 rpm) to develop a barley-oat breakfast cereal which were supplemented with 10% green or yellow pea. The impact of barley-oat ratio and additional pea on physicochemical properties of extruded cereal breakfast was determined. Generally, oat positively affected the hardness of the extrudates, and the hardest extrudates were obtained when the barley-oat ratio was 50:50%. The presence of green and yellow pea increased greenness, redness, chroma and browning index of the samples. The results of in vitro starch digestion test indicated that increase of oat ratio significantly decreased rapidly digested carbohydrates and starch digestibility AUC (area under the curve) (P < 0.05). However, the presence of peas did not significantly affect the starch digestibility AUC value. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The utilization of legume combinations with oat and barley grains can offer a unique balance of carbohydrate and protein composition of ready to eat cereal (RTE) products such as breakfast cereals. It is possible to manipulate the overall glycemic impact of RTEs through the careful utilization of cereal and protein blends.

"In this work, cellulase was used to treat with oat bran, and its effect on the total polyphenol content and phenolic profiles were investigated, with heating-only treatment as the control. Antioxidant capacity of the phenolic extracts from oat bran was assessed by scavenging of 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical cation, the ferric reducing antioxidant power, and protein oxidative damage protection assays. As a result, cellulase treatment significantly increased the total phenolic content, total antioxidant capacity, and the ability on the protection of protein from oxidative damage of the oat bran compared with heating-only treatment. Furthermore, cellulase treatment significantly increased availability of most phenolic compounds, except of gallic acid, such as caffeic acid by 97 % (5.33 vs. 10.51 mu g g(-1)), vanillin by 28 % (3.32 vs. 4.24 mu g g(-1)), p-coumaric acid by 105 % (5.55 vs. 11.35 mu g g(-1)), and ferulic acid by 914 % (12.33 vs. 124.03 mu g g(-1)). However, heating-only treatment had no significant influence on the five detected phenolic compounds.

"Oat beta-glucan consumption is linked to reduced risk factors associated with diabetes and obesity by lowering glycemic response and serum level of low-density lipoproteins. The purpose of this study was to identify the mechanism of action of oat beta-glucan at the interface between the gut wall and the lumen responsible for attenuating glucose levels. We proposed that viscous oat beta-glucan acts as a physical barrier to glucose uptake in normally absorptive gut epithelial cells IEC-6 by affecting the expression of intestinal glucose transporters. Concentration and time-dependent changes in glucose uptake were established by using a nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-D-glucose. The effectiveness of nutrient transport in IEC-6 cells was shown by significant differences in glucose uptake and corresponding transporter expression. The expressions of glucose transporters sodium-glucose-linked transport protein 1 (SGLT1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) increased with time (0-60 minutes) and glucose levels (5-25 mmol/L). The suppression of glucose uptake and SGLT1 and GLUT2 expression by increasing concentrations (4-8 mg/mL) of oat beta-glucan demonstrated a direct effect of the physical properties of oat beta-glucan on glucose transport. These results affirmed oat beta-glucan as a dietary agent for minimizing postprandial glucose and showed that modulating the activity of the key intestinal glucose transporters with oat beta-glucan could be an effective way of lowering blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes.

"Lipase inactivation is an essential treatment for oat processing, because of the negative effects of lipase on nutrient preservation and storage extension. The effects of different lipase inactivation treatments including hot air roasting, infrared roasting, normal-pressure steaming, and high-pressure steaming on the physicochemical properties of oat globulins were investigated. Results showed that normal-pressure steaming had little effect on solubility of oat globulins; hot air roasting increased foaming capacity of oat globulins but did not change their foaming stability; and all the inactivation treatments increased the surface hydrophobicity and content of total sulfhydryls of oat globulin but decreased exposed sulfhydryl groups. In addition, oat globulin granules from the hot air roasting treatment were distributed more evenly in oat globulin powder compared with the control group. All treatments except normal-pressure steaming changed the molecular weight of oat globulin subunits, which made the bands of 66,000 and 45,000 disappear from SDS-PAGE. These results indicated that normal-pressure steaming was ideal to maintain good solubility of oat globulins, and hot air roasting was ideal to maintain relatively good foaming properties. The treatments changed physicochemical properties of oat globulins by influencing protein aggregation and subunit composition that resulted in different content of sulfhydryl groups and surface hydrophobicity.",313,1,0,1,99,99,2,0,1,2,201
"This research compared the physicochemical properties of six milling oat cultivars from Western Australia over two growing seasons (2011 and 2012). Variations among the cultivars in physicochemical properties, particularly beta-glucan content, were assessed to determine their suitability for incorporation into white salted noodles at a level of 30% of the flour component. The average across six oat cultivars grown in 2012 was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for protein content, lipid content, and volume of smaller sized particles (< 100 mu m) and significantly lower for ash content, starch damage, and volume of larger particles (>100 mu m) in comparison with the average across the same oat cultivars grown in 2011. The year of cultivation by cultivar interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for ash content, protein content, beta-glucan content, starch damage, and particle size. Oat cultivar Mitika had the highest peak viscosity for 100% oat flour (whole groat) and 30% oat-wheat (OW) flour blend, which may be owing to lower amylose percentage, high protein content, and greater volume of smaller particles. The effect of growing season had greater impact on OW noodle firmness than the genetic effect of cultivars. The eating and cooking quality attributes of OW noodles, such as color, color stability, firmness, and cooking solid loss were superior for those incorporated with 2012 oat flour (whole groat) compared with 2011 oat flour. Among the six oat cultivars, Williams produced noodles with poor cooking and eating quality, and Mitika was easier to handle during processing and produced noodles with superior brightness and color stability in comparison with other oat cultivars evaluated.",314,99,99,1,99,99,1,0,0,4,263

Viability of the probiotic and the main technological, physico-chemical, nutritional and sensorial parameters were monitored at 7, 14 and 21 days of cold storage. The microbial survival was higher than 5x10(8) cfu g(-1) at the end of the shelf life. After the fermentation step, viscosity was higher in products inoculated with the exopolysaccharide-producing L. plantarum strain Lp90. However, a subsequent viscosity reduction was detected in all the samples throughout the storage period, consistent with the observed concentration decrease of the oat beta-glucan. Vitamin B2 content was about two-fold higher in products fermented by the riboflavin-overproducing LpB2, and in these samples the riboflavin concentration further increased during cold storage.

"Cereal mixed linkages (1 3) (1 4)--D-glucan is a linear polysaccharide composed of glucose units. Oat -glucan is a natural polymer. The main products of -glucanase are oligosaccharides with DP3 and DP4, i.e., 3-Ob-cellobiosyl-D-glucose and 3-Ob-cellotriosyl-D-glucose, which represent over 90% of the molecule. Keeping in mind all the benefits of oat bran, the present study was planned to investigate the structural properties of oat bran, high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection was used to examine these oligosaccharides. The structural analysis of oat bran of two oat varieties revealed that the ratio of soluble and insoluble triose to tetraose in -glucan fraction was 1.44 and 1.78, respectively, for Avon variety; while the ratio of soluble and insoluble triose to tetraose in -glucan fraction for Sargodha-81 was 1.49 and 1.77. The major units determined were cellotriose and cellotetraose. Other units cellopentaose and hexaoses were also existed but in minor fractions. Lichenase hydrolysis high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection appeared to be the best choice for structural analysis of purified samples of mixed-linkage -glucan.",316,-1,99,0,99,0,0,1,2,2,175
"Geometrical, functional, thermal properties and FTIR analysis of three varieties of oat flour (Sabzaar, SKO20, & SKO90) were investigated. Sabzaar showed highest thickness, geometric mean diameter, arthimetic mean diameter, sphericity and grain volume. The density of oat grains varied from 0.393 to 0.37 g/mL (bulk) and 1.2 to 1.8 g/mL (true). WAC showed significant (P < 0.05) difference among the cultivars with Sabzaar flour showing the highest value (2.36 g/g) and SKO20 (1.98 g/g) the lowest. Peak viscosity of oat flours was in the range of 460.33-489.33 cP. Flour samples showed the presence of small as well as large starch granules, oval or irregular shape with a smooth surface having some dents or fissures and some damaged starch and with varying dimensions. Average granule size of oat starch samples was within the range of 1.5-6.6 mu m in Sabzaar, 1.1-5.2 mu m in SKO20, and 1.7-6.8 mu m in SKO90. The gelatinization transition temperatures onset temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp), and conclusion temperature (Tc) varied significantly (p < 0.05) among three varieties.",317,99,99,0,99,99,0,0,1,4,172
"The thermal gelation of oat protein (OP) was investigated in the presence of polysaccharides at different pHs. The compressive stress dramatically increased in these phase-separated protein-polysaccharides gels due to an apparent increase in protein concentration. The polysaccharide structure significantly affected the degree of phase-separation and gel mechanical properties. The observed two-fold increase in gel compressive stress can be attributed to strong repulsive forces caused by carrageenan molecules. These resulted in a greater degree of phase-separation with the formation of carrageenan rich domains embedded in the protein phase, and a highly ordered protein network, stabilized by hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. In the case of OP-dextrin gels, the rate of phase separation was slower than the rate of protein aggregation, thus the dextrin particles were uniformly distributed within the protein network. This research contributes to the basic understanding required for designing textures for novel plant-based protein products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",318,1,99,1,0,99,2,0,1,2,152
"The primary objective of this study was to use the 5-Factor Satiety Questionnaire (Karalus, 2011) to compare the changes in satiation and satiety produced by eating oranges with the changes produced by eating oatmeal. A secondary objective was to compare the data from the 5-Factor Satiety Questionnaire with that from more traditionally used scales. Thirty participants evaluated hunger and fullness feelings before breakfast and at 0, 60, and 120 min after consuming breakfasts of equal volumes of oranges and oatmeal. We covertly recorded food intake from an ad libitum snack offered 2 h after breakfast. Oranges were less effective than oatmeal for decreasing mental hunger immediately after eating. Mental hunger increased more and mental fullness decreased more during the 2-h period after eating oranges than after eating oatmeal. Neither physical hunger changes nor physical fullness changes differed between the two foods. Participants ate more food at an ad libitum snack 2 h after eating the oranges compared with after eating the oatmeal. We were better able to distinguish the feelings produced by the oatmeal from the feelings produced by the oranges with the factor scales than with the traditional scales of hunger and fullness.

"BACKGROUND: The hypothesis that positive and negative interactions account for adaptive strategies was tested in a controlled study with two oat (Avena sativa) genotypes: 'Manotick' with erect leaves and 'Oa1316-1' with prostrate leaves. An increasing competition pattern was designed by varying the number of seeds planted in each container and the space between containers, thus creating different planting density regimes (i.e. alternative and solid treatments). RESULTS: Total biomass of individual plants tended to decrease exponentially with increasing density in both genotypes. Under high density stress, Manotick allocated more biomass to the roots and produced 50% more tillers, leading to more non-productive tillers and lower harvest index in the alternative than in the solid treatment. In contrast, Oa1316-1 allocated more biomass to panicles and stems, and less to the roots, with fewer tillers. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing density and strengthening intraspecific competition, Manotick reduced aboveground biomass allocation, leading to lower yield, while Oa1316-1 decreased allocation to the roots, but increased allocation to the panicles under an increasingly competitive environment. These adjustments were mechanically derived from negative and positive interactions, ensuring greater yield in the prostrate type. Our findings provided a novel rationale for a planting strategy based on plant type selections.

"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of molasses, lactic acid bacteria and propionic acid on the fermentation quality, aerobic stability and in vitro gas production of total mixed ration (TMR) silage prepared with oat-common vetch intercrop on the Tibetan plateau. TMR (436 g kg(-1) dry matter (DM)) was ensiled with six experimental treatments: (1) no additives (control); (2) molasses (M); (3) an inoculant (Lactobacillus plantarum) (L); (4) propionic acid (P); (5) molasses + propionic acid (MP); (6) inoculant + propionic acid (LP). RESULT: All silages were well preserved with low pH (< 4.19) and NH3-N contents, and high lactic acid contents after ensiling for 45 days. L and PL silages underwent a more efficient fermentation than silages without L. P and MP silages inhibited lactic acid production. Under aerobic conditions, M and L silage reduced aerobic stability for 15 and 74 h, respectively. All silages that had propionic acid in their treatments markedly (P < 0.05) improved the aerobic stability. After 72 h incubation, all additives treatments increased (P < 0.05) the 72 h cumulative gas production and in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) as compared with the control. L treatment decreased (P < 0.05) in vitro neutral detergent fibre degradability. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that TMR prepared with oat-common vetch intercrop can be well preserved. Although propionic acid is compatible with lactic acid bacteria, and when used together, they had minor effects on fermentation, aerobic stability and in vitro digestibility of TMR silage prepared with oat-common vetch intercrop.

"BACKGROUNDThe aim of present study was to investigate the hypocholesterolaemic effects of oat proteins (OP) in hamsters fed with a hypercholesterolaemic diet. The hamsters were divided into five groups and fed with the experimental diets containing oat, OP, oat -glucan (OG), or OP+OG for 30 days. RESULTSOP and the OG significantly lowered the concentrations of plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and liver total cholesterol (TC), and increased the excretion of faecal bile acid and TC. Plasma and liver TC in the OP+OG group were significantly lower than those in the OP or OG groups. Both OP and OG increased the activity of liver cholesterol 7-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), while its activity in the OP+OG group was strongly increased compared with the OP or OG groups. CONCLUSIONThese results indicated that dietary OP could improve hypercholesterolaemia, while dietary OP and OG together would have better hypocholesterolaemic effects.

"The morphology and granular properties of oat starch during germination were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffractometer. The granule size distribution of oat starch was studied in various concentrations in ethanol using a laser particle-size analyzer. The starch granule shape before germination remained almost the same after germination, as shown by low-magnification (x1000) scanning electron microscopy. However, surface fissures at high-magnification (x5000) were found on the sample at the end of germination. After soaking, the relative crystallinity of the samples significantly reduced, by following increased and then decreased, reaching a maximum crystallinity of 16% at the end of germination. In various ethanol concentrations, the size of starch granules produced in different germination phase slightly varied, but this difference was not easy to detect in the scanning electron microscope x1000 images. Overall, the particle size of oat starch generally decreased and the specific surface area increased significantly during oat germination.",323,99,99,1,99,1,2,0,0,3,152
"In view of their growing importance in human nutrition, incorporation of oats and cheese during the manufacture of short-dough type biscuits was studied. Rolled oats were incorporated at 25, 35 and 45 % of refined wheat flour in short-dough type biscuit formulation. Cheddar and processed cheese were used for flavouring purpose at three levels each, viz. 30, 40 and 50 % on flour basis. The dough exhibited less firmness on oats incorporation as indicated by lower firmness value (21.73 N) as against 25.05 N for control dough measured by Texture Analyser. Addition of cheese to the 25 % oat incorporated dough further reduced its firmness and altered its viscoelastic characteristics. Baking conditions for the oats and cheese incorporated biscuits were optimized as 165 A degrees C for 25-27 min. Sensory evaluation results revealed that the biscuit made from 25 % oat incorporated dough scored highest in most of the sensory attributes including overall acceptability. Cheddar cheese and processed cheese levels were optimized at 30 and 40 % in oats-incorporated dough based on the sensory analysis of biscuits prepared from the dough samples. The moisture and beta- glucan contents were 3.93 % and 0.62 %; 4.32 % and 0.60 % for cheddar cheese and processed cheese added biscuits, respectively. The spread ratios were higher in cheese incorporated biscuits than in oat incorporated biscuits. It was concluded that good quality cheese flavoured biscuits can be prepared by incorporating rolled oats in biscuit formulation along with cheddar or processed cheese.",324,0,99,99,99,99,0,0,1,4,247
"Oat has been recognized as a healthy food for a long time. In this study, physicochemical analysis including, moisture, pH, ash, fibres, proteins, starch, carbohydrates, some minerals, sugars, fatty acids, sterols, total phenolic, and flavonoid contents of four Moroccan Oat varieties (Amlal, Tissir, Zahri and Ghali) were investigated. Additionally, starch morphology has been described according to scanning electron microscopy, and viscosity as measured on a rotary rheometer, increased with stabilization time. Furthermore, Oat extracts were analyzed with regard to their antioxidant activities using DPPH radicals' cation, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity and ferric reducing/antioxidant power. Results from this investigation demonstrated that Moroccan Oat varieties constitute an interesting supplement of natural antioxidants, especially phenolic compounds. Moreover, potassium was the main mineral in Oat seeds (1628.17-2541.52 mg/Kg); also, the oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids were the dominant fatty acids. While the major sterols were, beta-sitosterol, Delta-5-avenasterol and campesterol. Finally, sugar analysis by HPLC-RI indicate that sucrose content was higher than glucose and fructose respectively, and that Ghali and Amlal varieties exhibit an important total sugars levels. Those results highlight the possible contributions of Oat seeds to nutritional therapy.",325,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,185
"An extruded product was made based on oats and dried green pea using central composite rotatable design. Effects of incorporation level of oat flour (OF, 15.86 to 44.14%) and dried green pea flour (DGPF, 7.93 to 22.07%) on the physical and functional characteristics of extruded products based on composite flour were studied using response surface methodology. Second order polynomial equation was used to describe the effect of OF and DGPF on lateral expansion (LE), bulk density (BD), water solubility index (WSI), water absorption index (WAI), and hardness (HD). Results indicated that OF had negative effect on LE, while positive effect on BD, WSI, WAI, and HD. On increasing DGPF, LE and WSI increased, but it had negative effect on BD, WAI, and HD. Numerical optimization resulted in 41.91% OF and 7.93% DGPF to produce acceptable extrudates.

"In this study, the changes in phenolic composition, total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacity of tarhanas supplemented with oat flour (OF) at the levels of 20-100% (w/w) after three drying treatments (sun-, oven-, and microwave drying) were investigated. A total of seventeen phenolic standards have been screened in tarhanas, and the most abundant flavonol and phenolic acid compounds were kaempferol (23.62 mg/g) and 3-hydroxy-4-metoxy cinnamic acid (9.60 mg/g). The total phenolic content amount gradually increased with the addition of OF to tarhana, but decidedly higher total phenolic content was found in samples oven dried at 55 degrees C as compared with other methods. The microwave- and oven dried tarhana samples showed higher TEAC(DPPH) and TEAC(ABTS) values than those dried with the other methods, respectively, in higher OF amounts. Consequently, oven- and microwave-drying can be recommended to retain the highest for phenolic compounds as well as maximal antioxidant capacity in OF supplemented tarhana samples.

"The use of oats in the human diet has decreased over the past 70 years. This is an unfortunate development from the perspective of human health because oats have a high nutritional value and contain many compounds, including beta-glucan, polyphenols, vitamins, and unsaturated fatty acids that are able to maintain or may even improve consumer's health. In addition, oats fit into a gluten-free diet of celiac disease patients because they lack the T-cell stimulating epitopes from wheat, rye, and barley. We focused on the presence of health-related compounds in oats and how their levels vary among varieties in response to the type of soil. Ten oat varieties were grown in the Netherlands in sandy and clay soil and were analyzed for the presence and concentration of healthy compounds beta-glucan, fatty acids, vitamin E, and antioxidant activity), avenin composition, total protein and starch content, and agronomical characteristics. Principal component analysis showed that genetic background influenced the levels of all analyzed components. Protein, starch, beta-glucan, and antioxidants were also affected by the type of soil. The obtained results showed that this kind of analysis can be used to profile oat varieties in general and enables the selection of specific varieties with specific compound characteristics.",328,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,202
"Oat beta-Glucans were studied for their immunological impact before and after enzymatic digestion in order to enhance the efficacy of oat beta-Glucans for application in functional foods. Oat beta-Glucan is reported to have minimal impact compared to its fungal counterpart in vitro. Digestion with endo-glucanase enhanced its efficacy towards stimulating MCP-1, RANTES, IL-8, and IL-4 production in human dendritic cells as compared to the nondigested beta-Glucan. This effect resulted from an enhanced activation of the Dectin-1 receptor. Our data suggest that the immune-stimulation was dependent on the beta-(1-3) linkages and the reduced particle size of digested beta-Glucans. Thus, we show that enzymatic pre-digestion of dietary fibres such as oat beta-Glucan enhances its impact on specific immune receptors. We also demonstrate that particle size and/or molecular weight of oat beta-Glucans and exposure of specific binding sites for the receptors might be important tools for designing efficacious functional feed and food additives.

"The distribution of a fraction of soluble dietary fibre (1,3)(1,4)-beta-D-glucans was depicted in selected Polish oat grains (Avena sativa L.). Localisation of beta-glucans within the grains was visualised by the light microscopy with Calcofluor white as a fluorescence agent. The content of beta-glucans varied in samples from 3.08% d.m. to 5.04% d.m. Analysis of distribution of (1,3)(1,4)-beta-D-glucans showed that the localization of beta-glucans varied between various cultivars and lines. It was demonstrated that the total content of (1,3)(1,4)-beta-D-glucans in oat kernels had an effect on their distribution. All the lines and cultivars tested displayed the greatest accumulation of (1,3)(1,4)-beta-D-glucans in the cells of the subaleurone layer. With increase in the levels of beta-glucans in high-glucan oat cultivars and lines, a tendency was observed towards their greater accumulation in the central parts of the kernel. It makes oat grain particularly suitable for the production of wholemeal foods. It is important not only to focus on increasing the content of beta-glucans, but also to investigate molecules distribution in the seed. It was also demonstrated that Dukat cultivar was characterised by an especially valuable triple aleurone layer, which makes this cultivar predestined for further breeding studies as an extremely valuable carrier of genetic information.",330,99,1,99,1,99,2,0,0,3,201

The best of them was mandarin by-product, achieving a maximum inactivation level against S. Typhimurium (8 log(10) cycles) with 5% at 5 degrees C. Also, this by-product had the highest total polyphenol content. Mandarin by-product showed a bactericidal effect in a food matrix also at 5 degrees C (approximate to 2 log(10) cycles). All results were adjusted to the Weibull model and the b values indicated that the higher concentration of mandarin, the greater the inactivation rate in reference medium, without significant differences between 5 and 10%. Similarly, in the food matrix, the inactivation rate of S. typhimurium was higher when the mandarin by-product was added. Therefore, the mandarin by-product could be used as a control measure of S.

"Oat bran is a gluten-free dietary fiber that may reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Currently, surimi, a derivative of seafood, is neither produced with fiber, nor has the effect of fiber on the physicochemical properties of surimi gels been thoroughly studied. In this context therefore, the purpose of this study was to address the physicochemical properties of surimi gels formulated with variable levels of oat bran while maintaining constant levels of protein and water. Oat bran and SiO2 incorporated in inverse concentrations were used in developing treatments of 0-8 g/100 g oat bran. Incorporation of oat bran up to 6 g/100 g greatly enhanced (P < 0.05) gel texture (Kramer shear force and texture profile analysis). Protein content that was rather elevated appears not affecting the pH. Surimi gels with oat bran would apparently reduce (P < 0.05) the whiteness, coincidental with L* but with increasing b* values. Water holding capacity concurrent with texture would likely improve (P < 0.05) with cooking loss probably due to the absorbent nature of oat bran. This study suggests that incorporating oat bran into surimi products would likely not compromise quality, which may be useful to manufacturers for marketing surimi products with added health benefits.

"Saponins are one type of widespread defense compound in the plant kingdom and have been exploited for the production of lead compounds with diverse pharmacological properties in drug discovery. Oats contain two unique steroidal saponins, avenacoside A, 1, and avenacoside B, 2. However, the chemical composition, the levels of these saponins in commercial oat products, and their health effects are still largely unknown. In this study, we directly purified 5 steroidal saponins (1-5) from a methanol extract of oat bran, characterized their structures by analyzing their MS and NMR spectra, and also tentatively identified 11 steroidal saponins (6-16) on the basis of their tandem mass spectra (MSn, n = 2-3). Among the five purified saponins, 5 is a new compound and 4 is purified from oats for the first time.

The dependent variables of interest for the textural properties were hardness, chewiness, gumminess, springiness and specific loaf volume. Increasing CMC (1-2 g) significantly (P<0.05) increased all the textural parameters of the bread, but not its specific volume (1.49-1.46 mL/g). YG significantly (P<0.05) decreased the hardness (786.01-593.39 N), chewiness (36.44-20.22 N) and gumminess (2.28-1.21 N), but sightly (P>0.05) increased the springiness (11.28-11.41 mm) and specific loaf volume (1.51-1.67 mL/g) of the resulting bread. TG significantly (P<0.05) affected all the textural parameters of oat bread, increased bread hardness (537.85-692.41 N), but decreased other parameters such as gumminess (4.66-2.14 N), springiness (6.47-4.14 mm), and specific loaf volume (1.61-1.54 mL/g) as the level of TG increased from 0.5 to 1.5 g. The objective of the optimization was to establish the amount of CMC, YG and TG required for optimal oat bread production. Hardness, chewiness, gumminess and springiness were used for numerical optimization to estimate the optimal level of ingredients for the production of oat bread. The predicted optimal ingredients for preparing oat bread were: CMC (1 g), yoghurt (33.75 g) and TG (0.98 g) with a desirability of 0.93. Practical ApplicationsThe consumption of oats is increasing worldwide, mainly due to the interest in novel and healthy foods as potential alternative ingredients to wheat flour for breadmaking. However, the absence of gluten development in oat dough leads to bread with a crumbling texture and other postbaking defects.

"The U.S. food and non-food industries would benefit from domestically produced crude, semi-pure and pure bio-based fiber gums from corn bran and oat hulls. Corn bran and oat hulls are processed to produce commercial cellulose enriched fiber gels, which generate an alkaline waste stream containing many valuable and functional components, including bio-based fiber gums. In this study, the corn bran and oat hulls processing waste streams were concentrated and drum or spray dried to produce solid products, called crude bio-based fiber gum (crude BFG). Alternatively semi-pure products (semi-pure BFG) were prepared by ethanol precipitation of the concentrated waste stream. Semi-pure product was also produced by purification of the original unconcentrated waste stream using 10, 50 and 100 kDa MWCO ultrafiltration membranes. A highly pure BFG was prepared from the unconcentrated waste stream by first adjusting its pH to 4, removing the precipitated material and precipitating the resulting supernatant with two times its volume with ethanol. All four kinds of BFGs contain arabinoxylan but with different levels of purity. The arabinoxylans have a typical structure with a slight variation in Ara/Xyl ratio showing some differences in their branching. There is a big variation in their weight average molar mass (Mw) (33-386 kDa) due to variation in the processing conditions of the waste streams. Arabinoxylans are good emulsifiers for oil-in-water emulsion systems and binding agents for petroleum coke pellets and briquettes.

"BACKGROUND-Glucan is widely considered to be the major ingredient responsible for the hypolipidaemic effects of oat. Determination of the -glucan content in naked oat cultivars in China has been largely performed for breeding and food processing. Since oat is generally consumed as oat flakes in China, evaluation of the bioactivity of oat flakes might be more direct and comprehensive than determination of the internal beta-glucan. However, the hypolipidaemic activity of oat flakes processed from Chinese oat cultivars has rarely been reported. RESULTSThe nutritional components of four naked oat cultivars were analysed before they were processed to oat flakes. The hypolipidaemic effects of oat flakes and the extracted beta-glucans were tested on rats fed a high-fat diet for 30 days. Oat flakes and -glucans of different origins showed different preventative effects on hyperlipidaemia. Among the four cultivars, beta-glucan of Bayou-1' showed the greatest hypolipidaemic effect. However, oat flake processed from Dingyou-7' showed the best bioactivity to mediate the increase of serum lipid. CONCLUSIONThe hypolipidaemic effect of oat might not only depend on beta-glucan, but might also be related to other components. Dingyou-7' might be suitable for oat flake processing because of its superior bioactivity. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry",337,1,1,99,99,99,2,0,0,3,199
"BACKGROUND: Many previous studies have reported the role of oat -glucan (OBG) in the reduction of postprandial glucose, and hypothesised that OBG may form a protective layer along the intestinal wall, acting as a viscous barrier to decrease glucose transportation. This study examined whether the molecular weight (MW) and concentration of OBG affected the diffusion of glucose in vitro. The effect of OBG on glucose transportation in vitro and sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) activity in the everted small intestines of normal rats was also examined. RESULTS: In vitro, higher MWs and concentrations of OBG increased the inhibitory effects on glucose diffusion and glucose adsorption. The transport of glucose by glucose transporters and Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the small intestinal mucosa of rats were significantly lower following the addition of OBG than those in the absence of OBG at the same time-points throughout glucose transportation (P<0.05). In the OBG-treated group, the Na+/K+-ATPase activity decreased with increasing OBG MW. However, as the concentration of OBG in the solution increased, the Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the small intestine increased due to stronger gastrointestinal motility. We also found that higher MWs of OBG had a greater inhibitory effect on intestinal disaccharidase activities in vitro. CONCLUSION: Oat -glucan is able to adsorb glucose molecules, inhibit glucose transport, decrease the concentration of available glucose and suppress disaccharidase activities in the small intestine.

The following microflora-associated characteristics were assessed before and after the intervention: intestinal gas production following lactulose ingestion, faecal excretion of SCFA and faecal levels of urease and beta-galactosidase. In addition, rectal levels of PGE(2) were measured. Microbial fermentation as evaluated by intestinal gas production and excretion of SCFA did not change significantly following the dietary intervention. However, faecal levels of beta-galactosidase and urease decreased after eating oatmeal porridge (P = 0.049 and 0.031, respectively). Host inflammatory state, as measured by rectal levels of PGE(2), also decreased, but the change was not significant (P = 0.168). The results suggest that oatmeal porridge has an effect on gut microbial functions and may possess potential prebiotic properties that deserve to be investigated further.",339,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,160
"Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) is a useful method in studying the water distribution and mobility in heterogeneous systems. This technique was used to characterize water in an oat beta-glucan aqueous system during cryogelation by repeated freeze-thaw treatments. The results indicated that microphase separation occurred during cryogelation, and three water components were determined in the cryostructure. The spin-spin relaxation time was analyzed on the basis of chemical exchange and diffusion exchange theory. The location of each water component was identified in the porous microstructure of the cryogel. The pore size measured from the SEM image is in accordance with that estimated from relaxation time. The formation of cryogel is confirmed by rheological method. The results suggested that the cryogelation process of the polysaccharide could be monitored by LF-NMR through the evolution of spin-spin relaxation characteristics.",340,99,99,1,0,-1,1,1,1,2,135
"Background: Foods that enhance satiety can help consumers to resist environmental cues to eat and help adherence to calorie restriction. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of 2 oat-based breakfast cereals on appetite, satiety, and food intake.Methods: Forty-eight healthy individuals, 18years of age or older, were enrolled in a randomized, crossover trial. Subjects consumed isocaloric servings of either oatmeal or an oat-based ready-to-eat breakfast cereal (RTEC) in random order at least a week apart. Visual analogue scales measuring appetite and satiety were completed before breakfast and throughout the morning. Lunch was served 4hours after breakfast. The physicochemical properties of oat soluble fiber (-glucan) were determined. Appetite and satiety responses were analyzed by area under the curve. Food intake and -glucan properties were analyzed using t tests.Results: Oatmeal increased fullness (p = 0.001) and reduced hunger (p = 0.005), desire to eat (p = 0.001), and prospective intake (p = 0.006) more than the RTEC. Energy intake at lunch was lower after eating oatmeal compared to the RTEC (p = 0.012). Oatmeal had higher viscosity (p = 0.03), -glucan content, molecular weight (p < 0.001), and radius of gyration (p < 0.001) than the RTEC.Conclusions: Oatmeal suppresses appetite, increases satiety, and reduces energy intake compared to the RTEC. The physicochemical properties of -glucan and sufficient hydration of oats are important factors affecting satiety and subsequent energy intake.",341,1,99,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,230
"There are few papers considering the effect of oat fiber particle size in bread production. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimizing the flour replacement (FR) and particle size (PS) with the oat fiber powder in the production of wheat bread rolls. Response variables are bread quality characteristics (yield, volume, moisture content, crumb and crust color, firmness, springiness, sensory attributes, and total dietary fiber (TDF) content). The results obtained in the study indicated that a lower size of dietary fiber resulted in increased yield and moisture content and decreased the volume. The color characteristics were slightly affected by FR and PS. The measured firmness increased when increasing FR and PS. The sensory analysis reveals that the most acceptable combination was the lowest FR with the highest PS. RSM was an efficient statistical tool to model the influence of FR and PS of the oat dietary fiber on wheat bread characteristics.",342,99,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,5,152
"Oat beta-glucan fiber powder was added to pasta dough at levels of 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200g/kg. Pasta was dried at very high temperature and in a vacuum dryer. The cooking quality was evaluated based on the swelling index, water uptake, and cooking loss measurement. Further tests were carried out to determine the color, hardness, adhesiveness, total dietary fiber (TDF), and beta-glucan content in pasta. The results showed that vacuum-drying had a significant impact on the cooking quality and physical properties of pasta. Water uptake and swelling index were higher and the cooking loss was lower in vacuum-dried pasta than in pasta dried using very high temperature (VHT) technology. The swelling index, water uptake, and cooking loss were significantly higher in samples with oat beta-glucan fiber powder compared to control. Pasta with oat powder was darker, softer, and less sticky than semolina pasta. Lightness of vacuum-dried samples was higher while redness was lower than in conventionally dried samples.",343,99,99,0,1,99,1,0,1,3,159
"Oat it is known as a cereal which provides numerous health benefits due to its composition. Likewise, hemp, flax and olive oils are rich in compounds required for the wellness maintenance and in prevention and treatment of various diseases. Thanks to advances of last decades in the food industry, it can be said that the rheological measurements have become indispensable in order to obtain a quality product. The aim of this work was to develop and optimize a technology for obtaining unfermented dough, respectively, to obtain oat based unleavened bread. The characterization of the final product from a sensorial point of view was performed, analysis very important for assessing the consumers acceptance. In the meantime the texture properties of all samples were instrumentally determined. Textural profile showed that samples containing higher percent of oil content had a lower hardness than those with reduced percent of oil. The most appreciated unleavened oat bread was dried at 150 degrees C and had a low content of oil.",344,1,99,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,165
"During conservation, the probiotic bacteria currently used in food industry have been shown to have less viability in the matter of fermented products microbiota and also to present lower levels of colonization and survival in vivo. This study describes a new way of improving the behavior and functionality of Lactobacillus acidophilus - LA 5 (R) commercial strain by using buckwheat flour (Fagopyrum esculentum) and oat bran (Avena sativa) as fermentation ingredients, in view of their high content of bioactive compounds that have a great impact both on fermentation microorganisms and consumers' health. The effect of these two raw vegetal products on LA 5 (R) strain was studied by cultivation on MRS broth and on milk. The supplementation of the fermentation medium with 4.0% - 6.0% of buckwheat flour or oat bran, respectively, had a positive effect on metabolic activity and viability of lactic acid bacteria. Thus, the rapid decrease of the pH and the increase of the multiplication rate were observed after 6 hours of lactic acid fermentation. Furthermore, the presence of the vegetal substrates substantially improved the cells survival during the storage of the fermented products for 28 days at 4 degrees C, comparing to samples without supplementation used as control.",345,1,1,99,1,0,3,0,1,1,202
"Analysis of the existing oat groat and Hercules flakes production processes suggests that oat processing technology largely corresponds to the conventional technologies prescribed in the applicable regulatory documentation. This process only allows for processing oat grains which conform to standard specifications. Use of off-spec grain results in production of low grade or non-conformant products, which considerably reduces the profit margin of such processing. This paper presents results of studies on non-standard oat grains processing. This grain differs from standard type in moisture content, in mass fraction of double grains, in mass fraction of small grains, and in grain admixture content (grain mixtures). A distinctive feature of the technologies we propose is the lack of this grain preparation stage preceeding the processing part. Use of the proposed technologies allows to increase both utilization and profitability of oat processing and groat production facilities. Our findings suggest that the proposed technologies provide considerable advantages. We have calculated the economic effectiveness of processing grains with four types of non-conformity. We demonstrated that use of this technology allows to reduce production costs of non-standard grain processing in producing Hercules oat flakes by up to 17.8% and result in a fully conformant product.",346,99,99,99,99,1,1,0,0,4,197
"The objective of this study was to investigate the structural characteristics and digestibility of resistant starches from highland barley starch, oats starch and buckwheat starch. The three cereal starches were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis (thermostable alpha-amylase 3 U center dot g(-1), pullulanase 40 U center dot g(-1)), autoclaved (121 degrees C, 30 min), stored under refrigeration (4 degrees C, 24 h) and dried (40 degrees C, 12 h). Particle size distribution analysis showed that the distribution of resistant starches was more concentrated than those of the native starches. Oat resistant starches had smaller granules and average grain diameter. Scanning electron micrographs of resistant starches presented an irregular shape that was different from native starches. The crystallinity pattern of three cereal resistant starches revealed B-type according to X-ray diffractograms. In vitro digestibility of three samples was analysed using a multi-enzyme dialysis system, which showed that the glycaemic index (GI) values of highland barley resistant starches (GI = 52), oat resistant starches (GI = 48) and buckwheat resistant starches (GI = 45) were significantly lower than those of native starches.",347,-1,99,99,1,0,1,1,1,2,178
"The effect of particle size and enhanced levels of high-fiber oat powder and vacuum-drying on pasta quality was investigated. Pasta was fortified with 100 and 200 g/kg of oat powder of fine, medium, and coarse particle size and dried with conventional air-drying and vacuum-drying. Cooking quality, textural properties, color, and total dietary fiber content were determined. The results revealed that particle size reduction and vacuum-drying had beneficial effects on pasta cooking quality and physical properties. Among the enriched samples, vacuum-dried pasta fortified with 100 g/kg of fine, high-fiber oat powder showed the most desirable properties. It was the firmest and lightest, had the lowest cooking loss, and the total dietary fiber content was enhanced to a level of 80.7 g/kg. The obtained results indicated that oat fiber fortification can increase dietary fiber intake, while optimal particle size and the drying method selected can have beneficial effects on the physical properties of pasta.",348,1,99,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,152
"Purpose - This study aims to develop fiber-enriched cutlets from minced meat of rohu and study the effects of fiber inclusion on composition, cooking properties and acceptability of cutlets. Design/methodology/approach - Cutlet mix prepared using rohu mince was divided into four lots, out of which three lots were enriched with fibers from ragi (RFC), jowar (JFC) and oat (OFC) at 10 per cent over and above its quantity. Prepared cutlets were analyzed for nutritional composition, texture, cooking properties and sensorial quality. Findings - Moisture, protein, fat, fiber and ash contents (per cent) of the fiber-enriched cutlets ranged between 40.4-42.0, 24.5-25.5, 13.2-14.7, 1.8-2.0 and 2.4-2.5 per cent, respectively. The addition of fibers increased the cooking yield of cutlets from 84.6 to 87.5 per cent. RFC lot cutlets had the lowest whiteness values and the highest hardness and shear force values. Cutlets from all the lots had an overall acceptability scores more than 7.0, indicating the sensorial acceptability. Although the differences were insignificant, cutlets from the RFC lot were less acceptable, which might be because of the dark color and tough texture. Hence, jowar and oat flour at 10 per cent can be used to enrich rohu cutlets without affecting their sensorial acceptability. Research limitations/implications - Sources of fiber will be the major limitation in the work, as the fiber inclusion may negatively affect the quality and acceptability of cutlets. Time of cooking will also influence the final product characteristics, which need to be standardized. Practical implications - Fish is a rich source of protein but lacks fiber, which is essential for body metabolism. Grains are rich source of fibers but lack some essential nutrients required by the body. In India, many people are dependent on fish for protein due to its high nutritious value. So enriching fish meat with fiber sources will address the health-related problems associated with low-fiber diets. The methodology developed in this work can b",349,1,1,99,-1,99,2,1,0,2,317
"The profiles of tocopherol (T) and tocotrienol (T3) homologues in 37 samples of seven different types of bran (rye, wheat, oat, spelt, buckwheat, rice, and corn), available on the Polish market, were studied. Tocochromanols were identified and quantified by reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatograph/fluorescence detector and reverse phase-ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry. Only rice bran contained all eight tocochromanol types. Corn bran lacked beta-T3; rye, wheat, oat, and spelt bran lacked gamma-T3 and delta-T3; and buckwheat bran lacked beta-T3, gamma-T3, and delta-T3. In buckwheat and corn bran tocopherols predominated (98 and 78%, respectively); whereas rye, wheat, oat, spelt, and rice bran were rich in tocotrienols (78, 76, 66, 87, and 66%, respectively). The average total tocochromanol contents in the oat, corn, spelt, buckwheat, wheat, rye, and rice bran were 5.5, 16.2, 15.8, 14.7, 12.8, 10.7, and 9.1 mg/100 g of dry weight, respectively. Tocochromanol concentrations in samples of the same type bran from different sources varied considerably.

"In response to the growing interest of modern society in functional food products, this study attempts to develop a bakery product with high dietary fibre content added in the form of an oat fibre powder. Oat fibre powder with particle sizes of 75 mu m (OFP1) and 150 mu m(OFP2) was used, substituting 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 % of the flour. The physical properties of the dough and the final bakery products were then measured. Results indicated that dough with added fibre had higher elasticity than the control group. The storage modulus values of dough with OFP1 most closely approximated those of the control group. The addition of OFP1 did not affect significantly the colour compared to the other samples. Increasing the proportion of oat fibre powder resulted in increased firmness, which was most prominent in wheat bread rolls with oat fibre powder of smaller particle sizes. The addition of oat fibre powder with smaller particles resulted in a product with the rheological and colour parameters that more closely resembled control sample.",351,99,99,99,0,1,1,0,1,3,174
"Background: In order to prevent chronic, non communicable disease, it is essential that lifestyle is modified to include a diet high in fiber. Aim: To assess the effect oat bran (OB) in conjunction with nutrition counseling (NC) have on lipid and glucose profile, anthropometric parameters, quality of diet, and ingestion of ultraprocessed foods (UPF) and additives in hypercholesterolemia sufferers. Method: This was a 90-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled, block-randomized trial undertaken on 132 men and women with LDL-c >= 130 mg/dL. The participants were sorted into two groups: OB Group (OBG) and Placebo Group (PLG), and were given NC and 40g of either OB or rice flour, respectively. Lipid and glucose profile were assessed, as were the anthropometric data, quality of diet (Diet Quality Index revised for the Brazilian population- DQI-R) and whether or not UPF or additives were consumed. Results: Both groups showed a significant decrease in anthropometric parameters and blood pressure, as well as a significant reduction in total and LDL cholesterol. There was also an improvement in DQI-R in both groups and a decrease in consumption of UPF. Blood sugar, HOMA-IR and QUICKI values were found to be significantly lower only in the OBG. Conclusion: Our findings in lipid profile and anthropometric parameters signify that NC has a beneficial effect, which is attributable to the improved quality of diet and reduced consumption of UPF Daily consumption of 40 g of OB was found to be of additional benefit, in decreasing insulin-resistance parameters.",352,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,243
"Increasing oats and beta-glucan extract intake has been associated with improved glycemic control, which is associated with the reduction in the development of diabetes. This study aims to assess the different effects between oat (whole and bran) and beta-glucan extract intake on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. PubMed, Embase, Medline, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched up to February 2014. We included randomized controlled trials with interventions that lasted at least four weeks that compared oats and beta-glucan (extracted from oats or other sources) intake with a control. A total of 1351 articles were screened for eligibility, and relevant data were extracted from 18 studies (n = 1024). Oat product dose ranged from 20 g d(-1) to 136 g d(-1), and beta-glucan extract dose ranged from 3 g d(-1) to 10 g d(-1). Compared with the control, oat intake resulted in a greater decrease in fasting glucose and insulin of subjects (P < 0.05), but beta-glucan extract intake did not. Furthermore, oat intake resulted in a greater decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (P < 0.001, I-2 = 0%) and fasting glucose (P < 0.001, I-2 = 68%) after removing one study using a concentrate and a different design and fasting insulin of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (P < 0.001, I-2 = 0%). The intake of oats and beta-glucan extracted from oats were effective in decreasing fasting glucose (P = 0.007, I-2 = 91%) and fasting insulin of T2D (P < 0.001, I-2 = 0%) and tented to lower HbA1c (P = 0.09, I-2 = 92%). Higher consumption of whole oats and oat bran, but not oat or barley beta-glucan extracts, are associated with lower HbA1c, fasting glucose and fasting insulin of T2D, hyperlipidaemic and overweight subjects, especially people with T2D, which supports the need for clinical trials to evaluate the potential role of oats in approaching to the management of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity of diabetes or metabolic syndrome subjects.",353,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,325
"and gluten-free oat flour. Proteins of all materials are rich in glutamic and aspartic acid, leucine and arginine. Proportions of amino acids in avenins extracted from most of oat raw materials are similar, excluding gluten-free oat flour, which has a very low avenin content and proportions of individual amino acids are different. The SDS-PAGE protein pattern consisted of proteins with molecular weight of about 25-35 kDa. Polyclonal anti-gluten antibody recognized all protein fractions of molecular weight higher than 20 kDa. Quantitative ELISA analysis shows that the majority of samples has a gliadin-like protein content within the range of 80-260 mg/kg, excluding gluten-free flours and corresponding bakery products. Altogether, beta-glucan preparation has extremely high level of gliadin-like proteins. Conclusion. In the examined oat raw materials and foods the contents of immunoreactive amino acid sequences exceeded the limit of 20 mg/kg (considered as gluten-free) except for gluten-free flours (oat and the prepared mixture) and the bakery products based on gluten-free flours. Unfortunately, the rest of oat raw materials and products cannot be considered gluten-free.",354,99,-1,99,1,0,1,1,1,2,172
"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of superfine grinding on the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of oat bran polysaccharides (OBP). The solubility of OBP increased from 8.1 to 11.3 mg/mL. The average molecular weights of raw OBP (rOBP) and superfine ground OBP (sOBP) were 655.6 and 489.6 kDa, respectively. The intrinsic viscosity of sOBP (4.58 mL/mg) was extremely lower than that of rOBP (94.75 mL/mg). The endothermic enthaphy change (Delta H) values of OBP with different water contents (0%, 50%, and 75%) changed from -328.79 J/g, -942.41 J/g, and -1.94 kJ/g to -197.01 J/g, -703.29 J/g, and -1.50 kJ/g, respectively. After being superfine grinding treated, sOBP exhibited higher antioxidant activities than rOBP based on FRAP, DPPH radical scavenging, and ABTS radical scavenging activities. The results suggested that superfine grinding treatment enhanced OBP's antioxidant activities. Physicochemical properties, including molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and solubility were key factors in OBP's antioxidant activities.",355,1,1,99,99,99,2,0,0,3,154
"Developing new antioxidants and using natural examples is of current interest. This study evaluated the antioxidant activities and the ability to inhibit soybean oil oxidation of oat oil obtained with different solvents. Oat oil extract obtained by ethanol extraction gave the highest antioxidant activity with a DPPH radical (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity of 88.2 % and a reducing power (A (700)) of 0.83. Oat oil extracted by ethanol contained the highest polyphenol and alpha-tocopherol content. Significant correlation was observed between the total polyphenol contents, individual phenolic acid, alpha-tocopherol, and DPPH radical scavenging activity. Soybean oil with 2 % added oat oil showed low malondialdehyde content (8.35 mmol mL(-1)), suggesting that the added oat oil inhibited oxidation. Oat oil showed good antioxidant activity, especially when extracted with ethanol which could also retard the oxidation of soybean oil . DPPH radical scavenging activity was the best method to evaluate the antioxidant activity and components of oat oil.",356,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,154
"The objective of this experiment was to study the effects of substituting oat grain with rice bran on energy, nitrogen and carbon balance, methane emissions, and milk performance in dairy goats. Ten Murciano-Granadina dairy goats in late lactation (46.1 +/- 3.07 kg) were assigned to 2 treatments in a crossover design, where each goat received both treatments in 2 periods. One group of 5 goats was fed a mixed ration with 379 g of oat grain/kg of dry matter (O diet) and the other group of 5 goats was fed a diet that replaced oat grain with 379 g/kg dry matter of rice bran (RB diet). Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and isoproteic, so bypass fat was added to reach the same amount of energy in both diets. The goats were allocated to individual metabolism cages. After 14 d of adaptation, feed intake, total fecal and urine outputs, and milk yield were recorded daily over a 5-d period. Then, gas exchange measurements were recorded individually by a mobile open-circuit indirect calorimetry system using a head box. Dry matter intake was different for both diets [1.83 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.61 +/- 0.08 (means SD), for O and RB, respectively]. Metabolizable energy intake and heat production were not significantly different between diets, with average values of 1,254 [standard error of the mean (SEM) = 110.0] and 640 (SEM = 21.0) kJ/kg of B-WW0.75, respectively. Significant differences were found in milk fat content (5.3 and 6.9%, SEM = 0.36; for O and RB, respectively) and milk fatty acids: medium-chain fatty acids (17.17 vs. 12.90 g/100 g, SEM = 0.969; for O and RB, respectively) and monounsaturated fatty acids (20.63 vs. 28.29 g/100 g, SEM = 1.973; for O and RB, respectively). Enteric CH4 emission was lower for the RB diet (23.2 vs. 30.1 g/d, SEM = 2.14; for O and RB, respectively), probably because of the higher lipid content in RB diets than O diets (11.7 vs. 4.1%, respectively). Lactating goats utilized RB without detrimental effects on energy metabolism. Higher milk fat and lower CH4 emissions were observed with th",357,0,1,99,99,1,2,0,1,2,348
"The effect of extrusion of barley and oat on the fecal microbiota and the formation of SCFA was evaluated using growing pigs as model system. The pigs were fed a diet containing either whole grain barley (BU), oat groat (OU), or their respective extruded samples (BE and OE). 454 pyrosequencing showed that the fecal microbiota of growing pigs was affected by both extrusion and grain type. Extruded grain resulted in lower bacterial diversity and enrichment in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with members of the Streptococcus, Blautia and Bulleidia genera, while untreated grain showed enrichment in OTUs affiliated with members of the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera, and the butyrate-producing bacteria Butyricicoccus, Roseburia, Coprococcus and Pseudobutyrivibrio. Untreated grain resulted in a significant increase of n-butyric, i-valeric and n-valeric acid, which correlated with an increase of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. This is the first study showing that cereal extrusion affects the microbiota composition and diversity towards a state generally thought to be less beneficial for health, as well as less amounts of beneficial butyric acid.",358,-1,1,-1,99,0,1,2,1,1,172
"The consumption of high nutritional value snacks may favorably affect the diet quality. Biscuits manufactured with oat flakes and maltitol were assessed for glycemic, insulinemic and ghrelin responses. Enrichment with inulin, a fructooligosachararide (FOS) which acts as soluble fiber, was performed in an attempt to further increase the dietary fiber content and examine potential additional postprandial benefits. Eleven healthy subjects participated in the study and consumed either 80 g oat biscuits (OB) or 81 g oat biscuits with 4% inulin (OBIN) or a solution containing 50 g of glucose (reference food), each yielding 50 g of available carbohydrates. Venous blood samples were collected before consumption and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min postprandially. The developed products were also evaluated for physicochemical properties, including porosity, density, texture, color, sensory attributes and microstructure (by scanning electron microscopy). Both biscuits demonstrated a low glycemic index (GI), which was found to be 32.82 +/- 8.07 for OB and 45.68 +/- 9.64 for OBIN. Compared to OB, OBIN demonstrated higher insulin response at 45 and 60 min and higher ghrelin suppression at 60 and 120 min postprandially (P < 0.05). Furthermore, OBIN demonstrated increased hardness and color values, lower porosity, and higher rate of starch granule gelatinization, without significantly altering the sensory attributes. Biscuits formulated with oat flakes and maltitol with or without 4% inulin can be classified as low GI foods. Inulin addition significantly lowered the ghrelin response to OBIN, suggesting an advantage of OBIN in the modulation of satiety; however, no further benefits regarding glucose and insulin responses were observed.",359,-1,1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,261
"Background: Oats provide important nutritional and pharmacological properties, although their safety in coeliac patients remains controversial. Previous studies have confirmed that the reactivity of the anti-33-mer monoclonal antibody with different oat varieties is proportional to the immune responses in terms of T-cell proliferation. Although the impact of these varieties on the adaptive response has been studied, the role of the dendritic cells (DC) is still poorly understood. The aim of this study is to characterize different oat fractions and to study their effect on DC from coeliac patients. Methods and results: Protein fractions were isolated from oat grains and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Several proteins were characterized in the prolamin fraction using immunological and proteomic tools, and by Nano-LC-MS/MS. These proteins, analogous to alpha-and gamma-gliadin-like, showed reactive sequences to anti-33-mer antibody suggesting their immunogenic potential. That was further confirmed as some of the newly identified oat peptides had a differential stimulatory capacity on circulating DC from coeliac patients compared with healthy controls. Conclusions: This is the first time, to our knowledge, where newly identified oat peptides have been shown to elicit a differential stimulatory capacity on circulating DC obtained from coeliac patients, potentially identifying immunogenic properties of these oat peptides.",360,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,199
"High protein and sugar-free cookies fortified with different levels of pea flour, soya bean flour and oat flakes, were developed. Sucralose was used instead of sucrose with the intention to develop sugar-free cookies. Proximate composition, storage stability tests, microbiological analysis and sensory evaluation was carried out. The results of the proximate analysis showed that the moisture, ash, crude fat, protein and total dietary fiber of fortified samples were higher than the control. The carbohydrate content of the fortified products was found to be lower than the control. However, the energy value of the fortified cookies was found to be higher than the control. It was, therefore, contended from the results that the cookies were sugar-free and protein rich. The cookies were stable both in terms of peroxide and acid values during two months of storage period, as both the values were within the permissible limits prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Microbial analysis of the cookies showed that there was not any microbial growth indicating the products are safe. Sensory evaluation of cookies showed that with regard to color, taste, flavor and texture, cookies with 5% to 10% pea flour and soya bean flour scored highest.

"By this study, nutritional compositions, phenolic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents, and enzyme activities after germination of oats (Avena sativa L.) were evaluated. Protein content significantly increased whilst ash, fat contents and total starch negligibly changed. The total phenolics increased by 0.5 mg ferulic acid equivalents g(-1) dry weight in the methanolic extract. In the water extract it was promoted 0.03 mg ferulic acid equivalents g(-1). The GABA content increased > 30% after 5 days of germination. Catechin, eligallocatechin and luteonin were found in only ungerminated seeds, whereas gallic acid, epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, ferulic acid were detected only in germinated seeds. Ellagic acid was observed in both ungerminated and germinated oats. The increase of > 30% inhibitory activity of alpha-amylase and reduction of > 25% of alpha-glucosidase inhibition proposed that germinated oats is a promising source for safe dietary supplements, despite further elaboration is needed.

"During the last ten years, Norwegian cereal grain industry has experienced large challenges due to Fusarium spp. and Fusarium mycotoxin contamination of small-grained cereals. To prevent severely contaminated grain lots from entering the grain supply chain, it is important to establish surveys for the most prevalent Fusarium spp. and mycotoxins. The objective of our study was to quantify and calculate the associations between Fusarium spp. and mycotoxins prevalent in oats and spring wheat. In a 6-year period from 2004-2009, 178 grain samples of spring wheat and 289 samples of oats were collected from farmers' fields in South East Norway. The grains were analysed for 18 different Fusarium-mycotoxins by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. Generally, the median mycotoxin levels were higher than reported in Norwegian studies covering previous years. The DNA content of Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium langsethiae, Fusarium poae and Fusarium avenaceum were determined by quantitative PCR. We identified F. graminearum as the main deoxynivalenol (DON) producer in oats and spring wheat, and F. langsethiae as the main HT-2 and T-2-toxins producer in oats. No association was observed between quantity of F. graminearum DNA and quantity of F. langsethiae DNA nor for their respective mycotoxins, in oats. F. avenaceum was one of the most prevalent Fusarium species in both oats and spring wheat. The following ranking of Fusarium species was made based on the DNA concentrations of the Fusarium spp. analysed in this survey (from high to low): F. graminearum = F. langsethiae = F. avenaceum > F. poae > F. culmorum (oats); F. graminearum = F. avenaceum > F. culmorum > F. poae = F. langsethiae (spring wheat). Our results are in agreement with recently published data indicating a shift in the relative prevalence of Fusarium species towards more F. graminearum versus F. culmorum in Norwegian oats and spring wheat.",363,-1,99,99,99,0,0,1,1,3,302
"Self-aggregating polymeric micelles are novel promising vehicles to solubilize and targeting delivery hydrophobic food ingredients. Solubilization of beta-carotene with octenylsuccinate oat beta-glucan (OSG) micelles, in terms of the apparent solubility of beta-carotene ([S](beta-car)), was investigated in this study. Its dependence on the degree of substitution (DS) and molecular weight (M-w) of OSG and stirrer input power (IP) was explored with the aid of response surface methodology (RSM). More importantly, the freeze-thaw, thermal and storage stability of beta-carotene-loaded OSG micelles were determined. Results from RSM revealed that the maximum [S](beta-car) (12.84 mu g/mL) encountered with the intermediate DS (0.0183), high M-w (17.1 x 10(4) g/mol) and IP (4.3 W). TEM images evidenced a minor deformation of OSG micelles upon beta-glucan solubilization. In terms of size and polydispersity index, beta-carotene-loaded OSG micelles exhibited good thermal stability, intermediate freeze-thaw stability and inferior storage stability. Furthermore, regarding to the retention of beta-carotene, beta-carotene-loaded OSG micelles were susceptible to thermal treatment and storage but kept stable against freeze-thaw treatment, but presented nice freeze-thaw stability. The loss of [S](beta-car) upon thermal treatment and storage was of temperature and time dependence. These results cast new light on the possible fortification of insoluble ingredients by OSG micelles in aqueous food systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",364,99,99,99,0,1,1,0,1,3,210
"Cell wall material from whole oat grains was sequentially extracted to study the structural characteristics of individual arabinoxylan (AX) populations. Araf was singly substituted at both O-3 (mainly) and O-2 positions of Xylp, and no disubstitution of Xylp with Araf residues was found in oat AXs. Both highly substituted and sparsely substituted segments were found in AXs in Ba(OH)(2) extracts, whereas AXs in 1 and 6 M NaOH extracts were rarely branched and easily aggregated. Both O-2-linked GlcA and 4-O-MeGlcA residues were present in oat AXs. A series of AX oligomers with galactose as a substituent was detected for the first time in oats. The present study suggested that the distribution of Araf was contiguous in oat AXs, different from the homogeneous distribution of Aral in wheat and barley AXs, which might result in different fermentation patterns in humans and animals.",365,99,0,99,1,1,2,0,1,2,141
"An experimental study was conducted to identify treatment conditions for sterilizing naked oats while retaining inherent enzyme activity. Naked oats were processed with superheated steam (SS) with variations in processing times (1-5 min) and temperature (140-200C). The number of bacteria and molds were significantly decreased as the SS temperature and exposure time increased. After naked oats were treated with SS at 160-170C for 2 min, the number of microbes were reduced below the safe storage limit. The SS treatment effectively reduced populations of bacteria and mold and had a less pronounced effect on enzymatic activity. This method shows great potential for usage as a sterilization treatment in the food processing industry.",366,1,99,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,111
"The objective of this study was to improve the shelf life and nutrition quality of bread by combination of part-baked frozen technology and white wheat flour replacement with 0, 10, 20 and 30% (w/w) of whole oat flour (WOF). Part-baked breads were produced at 200C for 7 min followed by freezing at -18C for 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days and re-baking at 230C for 8.5 min. Increasing the level of WOF enhanced water absorption, dough development time and dough softening while reduced dough stability time. Peak viscosity, trough and final viscosities reduced while pasting temperature increased. Baking weight loss increased with frozen storage time but reduced with addition of WOF. Frozen storage time and flour replacement enhanced bread density and firmness. Inclusion of maximum 10% WOF resulted in bread with similar sensory properties to those of control with a minimum shelf life of 28 days at -18C. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Oat grains are well known for their health benefits and have been used in bread and other foods to improve their nutritional value. Oat bread has been produced already by conventional methods, while there is little information to show the possibility of production of oat bread using part-baked frozen breads technology. This technology has a growing market as it can enhance the quality and shelf life of the bread. The results of this research indicated that replacement of maximum 10% wheat flour with whole oat flour can result in satisfactory part-baked bread with frozen shelf life of 28 days. This study can provide further information on application of whole oat flour as an excellent source of dietary fiber (mainly beta-glucan) and bioactive compounds with health benefits in bread production industry in order to respond to the increasing demand for a wider variety of healthy breads with longer shelf life.",367,99,1,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,300
"Scope: Numerous studies have shown that avenanthramides (AVAs), unique compounds found in oats, are strong antioxidants, though the mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether AVAs affect heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression through the activation of Nrf2 translocation. Methods and results: We investigated the effects AVA 2c, 2f, and 2p on HK-2 cells, and found that AVAs could significantly increase HO-1 expression in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that AVA-induced HO-1 expression is mediated by Nrf2 translocation. The addition of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), but not specific inhibitors of p38 (SB202190), PI3K (LY294002), and MEK1 (PD098059) attenuated AVA-induced HO-1 expression, demonstrating an important role for reactive oxygen species, but not PI3K or MAPK activation, in activating the HO-1 pathway. Moreover, hydrogenation of the double bond of the functional alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group of AVAs eliminated their effects on HO-1 expression, suggesting that this group is crucial for the antioxidant activity of AVAs. Conclusion: Our results suggest a novel mechanism whereby AVAs exert an antioxidant function on human health. Further investigation of these markers in human is warranted to explore the beneficial health effects of whole grain oat intake.",368,0,1,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,190
"The present study aimed to explore the metabolic response of oat bran consumption in dyslipidemic rats by a high-throughput metabolomics approach. Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were used: N group (normal chow diet), M group (dyslipidemia induced by 4-week high-fat feeding, then normal chow diet), OL group and OH group (dyslipidemia induced, then normal chow diet supplemented with 10.8% or 43.4% naked oat bran). Intervention lasted for 12 weeks. Gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to identify serum metabolite profiles. Results confirmed the effects of oat bran on improving lipidemic variables and showed distinct metabolomic profiles associated with diet intervention. A number of endogenous molecules were changed by high-fat diet and normalized following supplementation of naked oat bran. Elevated levels of serum unsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic acid (Log2Fold of change=0.70, P=.02 OH vs. M group), palmitoleic acid (Log2Fold of change-=1.24, P=.02 OH vs. M group) and oleic acid (Log2Fold of change=0.66, P=.04 OH vs. M group) were detected after oat bran consumption. Furthermore, consumption of oat bran was also characterized by higher levels of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine. Pathway exploration found that most of the discriminant metabolites were involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids, microbial metabolism in diverse environments and biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites. These results point to potential biomarkers and underlying benefit of naked oat bran in the context of diet-induced dyslipidemia and offer some insights into the mechanism exploration.

"Data from the 2001-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed to assess the relationship between oatmeal consumption and nutrient intake, diet quality, and physiological measures in adults 19 years and older (n = 22,823). We hypothesized that oatmeal consumption is associated with a more favorable nutrient intake profile, better diet quality, and healthier physiological end points. Oatmeal consumers (n = 1429) were defined as those who had consumed any amount of cooked oatmeal cereal during a 24-hour recall period. Multiple regression analysis, after transforming variables to normality and using appropriate sample weights to ensure national representation, was used to assess differences between oatmeal consumers and nonconsumers in terms of demographics, and covariate-adjusted analysis of variance was used to assess differences between consumers and nonconsumers in nutrient intakes, diet quality (calculated using the Healthy Eating Index-2010), and physiological measures. Our results show that oatmeal consumers were older than nonconsumers and more likely to be female; they also were less likely to smoke and consumed less alcohol. Consumers had higher intakes of protein, dietary fiber, vitamin A, thiamin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, copper, selenium, and potassium and lower intakes of total, monounsaturated, and saturated fats; cholesterol; and vitamin B-12. Oatmeal consumers had higher Healthy Eating Index-2010 scores and lower body weights, waist circumferences, and body mass indices. To conclude, our results suggest that consuming oatmeal is consistent with better nutrient intakes and a higher diet quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",370,1,1,1,-1,1,4,1,0,0,243
"Muffins made with wheat flour are a popular snack consumed in western and emerging countries. This study aimed to examine the content of amylose, glycemic response (GR) and glycemic index (GI) of muffins baked with refined wheat and rice flours, as well as wholegrain corn, oat and barley flours. This study adopted a randomized, controlled, crossover, non-blind design. Twelve healthy participants consumed wheat, rice, corn, oat and barley muffins once and the reference glucose solution three times in a random order on non-consecutive day. Capillary blood samples were taken every 15 min in the first 60 min and every 30 min for the remaining 60 min for blood glucose analysis. The Megazyme amylose/amylopectin assay procedure was employed to measure amylose content. The GR elicited from the consumption of wheat, rice and corn muffins was comparable between these samples but significantly greater when compared with oat and barley muffins. Consumption of wholegrain muffins, apart from corn muffin, blunted postprandial GR when compared with muffins baked with refined cereal flours. Muffins baked with wheat, rice, corn, oat and barley flours gave rise to GI values of 74, 79, 74, 53 and 55, respectively. The content of amylose was significantly higher in corn, oat and barley muffins than wheat and rice muffins. The greater content of amylose and fibre may play a part in the reduced glycemic potency of oat and barley muffins. Wheat flour can be substituted with oat and barley flours for healthier muffins and other bakery products.",371,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,247
"Peptides released from oat, buckwheat, and highland barley proteins were examined for their in vitro inhibitory effects on dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), an enzyme that deactivates incretin hormones involved in insulin secretion. All of the hydrolysates exhibited DPP4 inhibitory activities, with IC50 values ranging from 0.13 mg/mL (oat glutelin alcalase digestion) to 8.15 mg/mL (highland barley albumin tryptic digestion). The lowest IC50 values in gastrointestinal, alcalase, and tryptic digestions were 0.99 mg/mL (oat flour), 0.13 mg/mL (oat glutelin), and 1.83 mg/mL (highland barley glutelin). In all, 35 peptides of more than seven residues were identified in the tryptic hydrolysates of oat globulin using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy.

"Introduction: cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of morbidity worldwide. Such prevalence justifies the importance of functional foods that promote cardiovascular health, like beta-glucan present in oats, with potential hypocholesterolemic and hypoglycemic effects. Objective: to evaluate the effects of an intervention with oats in blood glucose levels, HOMA-IR index, lipid profile, weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) of adult users of a health service in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Methods: longitudinal study, case-control type with before and after experiment, conducted with individuals that are 22-60 years old, users of a health service. The individuals were distributed in Control (usual diet) and Case (usual diet + 40 g oats/day) groups. There was performed, at the beginning of the study and after eight weeks of monitoring, measuring of height and weight, calculation of BMI (kg/m(2)), blood collection for measurement of fasting glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol; and there were calculated the LDL cholesterol and HOMA-M index. The data was expressed as mean standard deviation and percentages. The Kohnogorov-Smirnov test, Student t test, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were applied. A significance level of 5% was adopted (p <0.05). Results: the sample consisted of 82 subjects, divided into cases (n=38) and controls (n=44), mean age 40.07 +/- 10.49 years old, 58.5% were women. Comparing the results of all measured parameters at baseline and after eight weeks of monitoring, the Control group did not achieve a significant reduction in any parameter, showing a significant increase in blood glucose and HO-MA-IR (p <0.05).

"Background: The aim of present study is to investigate the influences of brewing and boiling on hypocholesterolemic effect of oatmeal in rats fed with a hypercholesterolemic diet. Methods: Fifty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups of 8 rats each with similar mean body weights and serum cholesterol concentrations. Rats were fed with the experimental diets containing 10 % of oatmeal from two Chinese oat varieties which were brewed or boiled for 30 days. The lipids levels in serum, liver, and faeces were determined. Results: The effects of feeding boiled oatmeal on lowering lipid concentrations in plasma and liver were more significant than that of brewed oatmeal (P < 0.05). Feeding boiled oatmeal was also more efficient in increasing fecal total lipids, cholesterol and bile acids as compared to feeding brewed oatmeal (P < 0.05). Boiled oatmeal had higher apparent viscosity and soluble beta-glucan content than the brewed oatmeal did (P < 0.05). Conclusion: These results indicated that the capability of boiled oatmeal in improving cholesterol metabolism is better than that of brewed oatmeal, which is mainly attributed to its higher soluble beta-glucan content and apparent viscosity.",374,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,188
"Background. Cereal products constitute the basis of the diet pyramid. While the consumption of such products as bread decreases, the group of food which popularity increase is cereal snacks. Unfortunately, the dietary value of this group of foodstuffs is limited. Thus, different types of cereal bran may be added to the produced snacks to enhance their nutritive value. However, an addition of bran may have an adverse effect on quality attributes of products. Material and methods. Corn grits enriched with 20 and 40% oat, wheat and rye bran was extruded. Basic parameters determining the nutritive value, physical characteristics and sensory attributes of the six produced types of extrudates were measured and compared. Moreover, the effect of additives applied on viscosity of aqueous suspensions of the raw materials and extrudates under controlled conditions was measured using RVA. Results. The dietary value of snacks containing bran depends on the type and quantitative shares of the additives. The content of dietary fibre in produced extrudates ranged from 6.5 to 15.8%, including soluble dietary fibre at 2.1 to 3.7%. With an increase of bran content in extrudates, their expansion decreased, density increased and the colour of extrudates changed (reduced brightness, increased a*, decreased b*). In sensory evaluation the highest acceptability was given to extrudates with a 20% addition of oat bran, while the lowest was given for those with 40% wheat bran. Based on PCA results positive correlations were found between overall desirability and crispiness, porosity, taste, colour and expansion. Negative correlations between desirability and hardness and density of extrudates were observed. The additives and their level also had an effect on changes in viscosity of aqueous suspensions measured using RVA. However, no correlation was found between quality features of extrudates and values of attributes measured in the analysis of viscosity. Conclusion. In the production of corn extruded snacks an addition of oat, wheat and",375,1,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,311
"The effects of yeast, carboxylmethylcellulose (CMC), plain yoghurt (YG), transglutaminase (TG) and cyclodextrinase (CG) on the mixing properties of oat dough were investigated through the use of DoughLab. A 2(5-2)fractional factorial design resolution III with yeast (1.25, 3.25 %), CMC (1, 2 %), YG (10.75, 33.75 %), TG (0.5, 1.5 %) and CG (10, 40 mu l) as independent variables was implemented. The parameters measured were water absorption, arrival time, stability, energy at peak, peak resistance, development time, departure time, softening and bandwith at peak. CMC significantly (p < 0.05) increased stability, energy at peak, development and departure times, but significantly (p < 0.05) decreased water absorption, peak resistance, softening and bandwidth at peak. TG signficantly increased water absorption, peak resistance and softening, but significantly decreased energy and development time. YG significantly (p < 0.05) decreased all the parameters measured, with the exception of softening, which was significantly increased. In contrast, yeast and cyclodextrinase did not significantly affect the oat dough during mixing. Principal component analysis indicated that 85.5 % of the variation in the data could be explained by two components. Component 1 explaining 52.3 % of the variation loaded highly on dough strength (stability and departure time). Component 2 contributing 33.2 % of the variation loaded on dough resistance (water absorption and peak resistance). CMC significantly increased dough strength while yoghurt reduced it significantly. TG significantly (p < 0.05) increased the resistance of the dough to mixing while CMC and yoghurt reduced it significantly (p < 0.05). Hence, CMC, TG and yoghurt are ingredients of choice when modifying oat dough mixing properties.",376,99,1,99,1,99,2,0,0,3,264
"In order to determine the impact of Stevie rebaudiana (SR) addition on bioactive compounds bioaccessibility of a new developed functional beverage based on exotic fruits (mango juice, papaya juice and gal) mixed with orange juice and oat, an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed. Ascorbic acid, total carotenoids, total phenolics, total anthocyanins, total antioxidant capacity and steviol glycosides were evaluated before and after a simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Salivary and gastric digestion had no substantial effect on any of the major phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid, total antioxidant capacity and steviol glycosides, whereas carotenoids and anthocyanins diminished significantly during the gastric step. All analysed compounds were significantly altered during the pancreatic-bile digestion and this effect was more marked for carotenoids and total anthocyanins. However, phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, total antioxidant capacity and steviol glycosides bioaccessibility increased as did SR concentration.

"Food hydrocolloids impact on human health is usually associated with positive interaction within gastrointestinal track and connected immune response. One of the most underestimated organs which reflect pathological changes appearing systemically is spleen. Acting not only as blood storage but as active organ the spleen play an important role in innate immunity which can be stimulated by alimentary treatment of immune active food hydrocolloids. Two oat beta-glucan purified preparations with high (2,179,700 g/mol) and low (69,700 g/mol) molecular weight were prepared and their antioxidant, free radical scavenging activity, the ability to alleviate inflammatory conditions and protective properties against severe oxidant induced lipid peroxidation were evaluated. This study was performed on rats, divided into 3 groups: fed control diet and diet supplemented with small molecular mass and large molecular mass oat beta-glucans. Within groups animals were divided into controls and individuals with experimentally induced intestinal inflammation. Low molecular weight beta-glucan diet supplementation effectively decreased oxidative stress parameters in the control groups. The supplementation with high molecular weight beta-glucan in animals with inflammation decreases lipid superoxides, 7-ketocholesterol concentration and GSSG activity in rat spleens. In conclusion, beta-glucan possesses antioxidant properties as manifested by a reduction in superoxide dismutase and reductase activity. This study also demonstrated that diet supplementation with beta-glucan improves stress oxidative parameters in the spleen. It is especially important in the case of rats with induced gut inflammation. The encouraging results obtained from our experiment enables the use of this food hydrocolloid to form food formulation with protecting health properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Oats are mostly used for porridges, flakes, and cereal breakfast. The current oat kilning and milling methods are suited for these purposes. Bread-making applications have been explored, but the bread quality results are far from optimal. The goals of this study were to determine whether infrared (IR) and steam kilning may impact dough rheology, and to assess if particle size distribution and bran content could impact dough properties. IR kilning had a negative effect on the dough-making properties of oat grains, resulting in a very stiff and short dough, while steam-kilned dough did not change the dough-making properties. Oat meal also resulted in a stiff and short dough, and re-milling did not change this pattern. In contrast, removing all the bran from the oat meal improved dough-making properties. Dough rheology was negatively impacted by the bran, and this effect was larger for large and medium size bran than for fine bran. This was attributed to their high content of beta-glucans. In conclusion, current kilning and milling methods are not suitable for bread-making purposes and these treatments must be optimized. Whole grain oat meal is not a proper material for bread applications in the absence of fractionation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",379,99,-1,99,-1,-1,0,3,0,2,203

Supplementation with oat AFPs lowered the freezable water content of the dough, resulting in some beneficial effects on final steamed bread. The rheological properties of the oat AFP group showed a greater fermentation capacity than did the control group (without oat AFP). A scanning electron microscopic analysis showed that supplementation with oat AFPs could protect the gluten matrix from disruption, thus resulting in superior textural properties in the steamed bread.

"Oat beta-glucan and its hydrolyzates were used as fat replacers in the production of meatballs. The physicochemical properties of raw (OG) and hydrolyzed oat beta-glucan (OGH), as well as their application in meatballs were studied. The average molecular weight of OG and OGH was determined by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and was found that OGH decreased from 6.6 x 10(6) Da to 9.4 x 10(5) Da (OG) after 1.5 h of enzymatic hydrolysis at 55 degrees C and pH 5.5 using a cellulase dose of 76 U/g. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis was applied to measure the size distribution of OG and OGH. The mean diameters of OG and OGH were 126.6 nm and 110.3 nm, respectively. The apparent viscosity of OG and OGH was studied at different concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%, 3.0%) and shear rates (1-300(-1)). Both OG and OGH had shear-thinning behavior and OGH exhibited a small decrease in the apparent viscosity. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed that OGH and OGH-added meatball (OGHM) had larger T-p than those of OG and OG-added meatball (OGM), respectively. SEM images of OGHM exhibited a more smooth surface than blank meatballs. Textural analysis and sensory evaluation results indicated that the OGH added with 10% fat-rich meatball showed the highest overall acceptability among the meatball samples, therefore oat beta-glucan hydrolyzates are very promising dietary fiber source used as fat replacer in traditional meatball production.

"Oat bran (OB) is a high fibre source with human health benefits. Gluten-free cookies were prepared by incorporation of OB (0%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 100%) into oat flour (OF). Dough rheology for OF/OB mixtures indicated no change in starch gelatinization and retrogradation between 30% and 70% OB when compared with OF. OB incorporation increased protein weakening and decreased the stability of gelatinized starch. Cookies were evaluated based on thermal properties and the enthalpy decreased by 60%. SEM revealed differences in internal structure of the cookies and e-nose technique provided a good discrimination of cooldes based on the overall flavour. The highest beta-glucan content (4.37% dm) was achieved in the 100% OB cookies with an overall acceptability of 5.6. Incorporation of OB provided darker samples and cooldes become more brittle (hardness was reduced to 18.33 N).

"The presence of toxicogenic Staphylococcus aureus in foods and the dissemination of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in the food chain are matters of concern. In the present study, the circular bacteriocin enterocin AS-48, applied singly or in combination with phenolic compounds (carvacrol, eugenol, geraniol, and citral) or with 2-nitro-1-propanol (2NPOH), was investigated in the control of a cocktail made from 1 methicillin-sensitive and 1 MRSA strains inoculated on commercial oat and soya drinks. Enterocin AS-48 exhibited low bactericidal activity against staphylococci in the drinks investigated when applied singly. The combinations of sub-inhibitory concentrations of enterocin AS-48 (25 mu g/mL) and phenolic compounds or 2NPOH caused complete inactivation of staphylococci in the drinks within 24 h of incubation at 22 degrees C. When tested in oat and soya drinks stored for 7 d at 10 degrees C, enterocin AS-48 (25 mu g/mL) in combination with 2NPOH (5.5 mM) reduced viable counts rapidly in the case of oat drink (4.2 log cycles after 12 h) or slowly in soya drink (3.8 log cycles after 3 d). The same combined treatment applied on drinks stored at 22 degrees C achieved a fast inactivation of staphylococci within 12 to 24 h in both drinks, and no viable staphylococci were detected for up to 7 d of storage.

"Oats (Avena sativa L.) were revaluated in recent years as a promising crop for improving the nutritional quality of foods, due to their richness in many bioactive compounds, including phenols. These plant secondary metabolites are useful as radical scavenging, and also possess positive biochemical effects against cardiovascular diseases, cancer growth and age-related diseases. Twenty oat cultivars were analyzed for their soluble phenol content (SPC, ranging 0.78-1.09 g(GAE)/kg d.m.) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC, ranging 13.99-18.84 mmol TE/kg d.m.). In another experiment, the kinetics of SPC accumulation and TAC in the immature grains of five oat cultivars revealed a marked decrease of both parameters (-48.9% and -72.1%, respectively) from ten days after anthesis to maturity. These results could suggest a possible use of immature oat grains in human nutrition, as it was already proposed for other cereals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"In this work, a-amylase was used to treat oat flour with the intent to release phenolic compounds with known antioxidant properties. After methanol extraction, the amounts of nine beneficial phenolic compounds were measured using HPLC. The antioxidant activities of the extracts were assessed using 2,2'-azinobis (3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and protein oxidative damage protection assays. Compared with heating-only treated oat flour, that treated with a-amylase showed significant increase of extractable total phenolic content (0.46-135 mu mol gallic acid equivalents per gram oat), total antioxidant capacity, and an increased ability on the protection of protein from oxidative damage. Heating-only increased caffeic acid and vanillin content by 17 (0.03 vs 0.54 mu g/g oat) and 1.8 (0.62 vs 1.11 mu g/g oat) folds, but slightly increased the content of other phenols. Excluding heating effect, a-amylase treatment increased gallic acid content by 2.6 folds (0.38 vs 1.38 mu g/g oat), caffeic acid content by 2.4 (0.54 vs 1.82 mu g/g oat) folds, and other phenols by 1.0-1.8 folds. In conclusion, a-amylase treatment can yield oat products containing more extractable phenolic compounds with increased antioxidant capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of heat treatment on the soluble protein content in oat groats (Kerstin commercial variety) was evaluated using asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) in combination with online multiangle light scattering (MALS) and UV detection. The AF4 method was used to separate the monomeric proteins from globulin hexamer and aggregate proteins and beta-glucan polysaccharides in the soluble oat protein fraction. The total amount of soluble protein (with respect to total protein) was reduced to 35.7 +/-- 4.5 wt. % in heat treated oats from 74.6 +/- 5.3 wt. % in non-heat treated oats. The ratio of monomeric to globulin hexamer and aggregate proteins was reduced from 1.82 to 1.48 as a result of heat treatment. Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis revealed the selective elimination of protein bands associated with the albumin and prolamin protein fractions as a result of heat treatment. These results were supported through amino acid analysis by cation exchange chromatography coupled with UV detection which revealed a reduction in amino acid residues associated with prolamin. The globulin proteins were found to be less sensitive to heat treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,388,99,99,-1,99,99,0,1,0,4,188
"In addition to their fermentable dietary fiber and the soluble beta-glucan fiber, oats have unique avenanthramides that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that reduce coronary heart disease in human clinical trials. We hypothesized that oat consumption will increase insulin sensitivity, reduce body fat, and improve health span in Caenorhabditis elegans through a mechanism involving the daf-2 gene, which codes for the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 like receptor, and that hyperglycemia will attenuate these changes. Caenorhabditis elegans wild type (N2) and the null strains sir-2.1, daf-16, and daf-16/daf-2 were fed Escherichia coli (OP50) and oat flakes (0.5%, 1.0%, or 3%) with and without 2% glucose. Oat feeding decreased intestinal fat deposition in N2, daf-16, or daf-16/daf-2 strains (P < .05); and glucose did not affect intestinal fat deposition response. The N2, daf-16, or sir-2.1 mutant increased the pharyngeal pumping rate (P < .05), a surrogate marker of life span, following oat consumption. Oat consumption increased ckr-1, gcy-8, cpt-1, and cpt-2 mRNA expression in both the N2 and the sir-2.1 mutant, with significantly higher expression in sir-2.1 than in N2 (P < .01). Additional glucose further increased expression 1.5-fold of the 4 genes in N2 (P < .01), decreased the expression of all except cpt-1 in the daf-16 mutant, and reduced mRNA expression of the 4 genes in the daf-16/daf-2 mutant (P < .01). These data suggest that oat consumption reduced fat storage and increased ckr-1, gcy-8, cpt-1, or cpt-2 through the sir-2.1 genetic pathway. Oat consumption may be a beneficial dietary intervention for reducing fat accumulation, augmenting health span, and improving hyperglycemia-impaired lipid metabolism. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"Fall-grown oat has shown promise for extending the grazing season in Wisconsin, but the optimum date for initiating grazing has not been evaluated. Our objectives for this project were (1) to assess the pasture productivity and nutritive value of 2 oat cultivars [Ogle and ForagePlus (OG and FP, respectively)] with late-September (EG) or mid-October (LG) grazing initiation dates; and (2) to evaluate growth performance by heifers grazing these oat forages compared with heifers reared in confinement (CON). A total of 160 gravid Holstein heifers (80 heifers/yr) were assigned to 10 research groups (8 heifers/group). Mean initial body weight was 509 +/- 40.5 kg in 2013 and 517 +/- 30.2 kg in 2014. Heifer groups were assigned to specific pastures arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial of oat cultivars and grazing initiation dates. Grazing heifer groups were allowed to strip-graze oat pastures for 6 h daily before returning to the barn, where they were offered a forage-based basal total mixed ration. Main effects of oat cultivar and sampling date interacted for forage characteristics in 2013, but not in 2014. During 2013, oat forage mass increased until early November before declining in response to freezing weather conditions, thereby exhibiting linear and quadratic effects of sampling date, regardless of oat cultivar. Similar trends over time were observed in 2014. For 2013, the maximum forage mass was 5,329 and 5,046 kg/ha for FP and OG, respectively, whereas the mean maximum forage mass for 2014 was 4,806 kg/ha. ForagePlus did not reach the boot stage of growth during either year of the trial; OG matured more rapidly, reaching the late-heading stage during 2013, but exhibited only minor maturity differences from FP in 2014. For 2013, average daily gain for CON did not differ from grazing heifer groups (overall mean = 0.63 kg/d); however, average daily gain from FP was greater than OG (0.68 vs. 0.57 kg/d), and greater from EG compared with LG (0.82 vs. 0.43 kg/d).

"In order to improve the functionality of oat (Avena nuda L.) beta-glucans and widen their applications in food industry, the oat bran was processed by ultrafine grinding and enzymatic hydrolysis, and extracted to obtain oat beta-glucans. The extracted oat beta-glucans were characterized by the molecular weight distribution, particle size, rheological properties, thermal stability, solubility and water holding capacity, and morphological properties. The average molecular weight of raw oat beta-glucans (OBG-1) and ultrafine ground oat beta-glucans (OBG-2) were 2.79 x 10(5) Da and 3.26 x 10(5) Da, respectively; while the average molecular weights of cellulase hydrolyzed oat beta-glucans (OBH-1 and OBH-2) significantly decreased to 1.98 x 10(5) and 1.05 x 10(5) Da. The particle size, thermal stability, solubility and water holding capacity showed significant correlation with molecular weight distribution. Both OBG-1 and OBG-2 had shear-thinning behavior, whereas OBH-1 and OBH-2 exhibited shear-thickening behavior. Scanning electron microscope observation suggested that cellulase hydrolyzed oat beta-glucans had fibrous structures with granular particles in aggregates sticking to the fibrous skeleton. Compared with raw and ultrafine ground oat beta-glucans, the partially hydrolyzed oat beta-glucans showed different rheological properties, which might be of potential use in the food industry.

"Pretreatment of oat protein with ultrasound showed excellent prospects in increasing the efficiencies of enzymatic hydrolysis and inhibitory activities of peptides against angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The mechanism of the ultrasound pretreatment on enhancement of protein hydrolysis rate and the characterization of the enzymolysis process was investigated. The Michaelis-Menten model was used to study the effects of ultrasound on the hydrolysis rate. An ordered sequential bi-substrate reaction mechanism model was applied to describe the characteristics of enzymolysis of the protein with ultrasonic pretreatment. The protein concentration and the enzyme loading were factors in this model. The kinetic parameters of the models were estimated by experimental results and evaluated. The results showed that ultrasonic power, time and enzymolysis time greatly influenced the degree of hydrolysis and ACE inhibitory activities of the peptides. The best conditions for hydrolysis and ACE inhibitory activities were 750 W, 20 min of sonication followed by 60 min of enzymolysis. After the treatment, the hydrolysis rate and the ACE inhibitory activities of peptides were significantly (P < 0.001) increased by 32.1 and 53.8 %, respectively compared to the samples without ultrasonic pretreatment. The Michaelis constant K (m) indicated the ultrasonic treatment enhanced the affinities between the alcalase and oat protein. The enzymolysis kinetic model fitted well the enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis trend for the ultrasonic pretreated oat protein. The model provided a theoretical basis for describing the complex enzymatic process and preparing the ACE inhibitory peptides efficiently.",392,99,99,99,0,1,1,0,1,3,239
"Amaranth-oat composites were developed using gluten free amaranth flour containing essential amino acids and minerals with oat products containing beta-glucan, known for lowering blood cholesterol. Amaranth-oat composites were used in sugar cookies for improving their nutritional and physical qualities. The physical properties of amaranth-oat composites, and their cookies and doughs were compared with amaranth or wheat flour alone. The pasting viscosities of amaranth-oat 3:1 composites were similar to amaranth flour alone, and they were all higher than wheat flour. The study showed amaranth and its composites had more viscous properties and improved water holding capacities compared to wheat flour. Differences were also found in geometrical properties and texture properties of the dough and cookies. However, the amaranth oat cookies were acceptable in color, flavor and texture with no significant differences in sensory qualities compared to wheat flour cookies. Also, the cookies using amaranth oat composites had enhanced nutritional value with gluten free uniqueness that could be useful for functional foods.

"The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of high-fiber oat powder addition and vacuum drying on the hydration properties and colour of pasta. Durum wheat semolina was substituted with 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 g/100 g of high-fiber oat powder. A short cut pasta (fusilli) was processed from wheat semolina and dried in very high temperature in conventional drying system and by using vacuum-dryer. Pasta properties including optimal cooking time, swelling index, water uptake, cooking loss and colour were evaluated. Drying curves for different drying conditions were determined. The results showed that the drying method and oat powder addition level had significant impact on the pasta colour and hydration properties (P <= 0.05). Lightness and yellowness were significantly higher in vacuum-dried pasta. Value L* and a* were significantly different in samples with oat powder than in control sample. Water uptake was higher in Samples containing high-fiber oat powder than in control sample. Water uptake and swelling index were higher in vacuum-dried samples. Optimal cooking time was decreasing with growing oat powder addition level. The drying curve indicated that vacuum-drying allowed faster water evaporation than atmospheric drying.

"The effect of inulin addition at low concentrations (0.1-0.5%) on the thermal gelation of oat protein gels was investigated using textural profile analysis, rheological measurements and microstructure observation through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Results indicate that oat protein hexamers were dissociated with heat into monomers, which then became the reactive units involved in the development of a unique percolating network. The major forces responsible for the establishment of the structure were disulphide bonds, as well as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces. A small amount of inulin can greatly increase the compressive stress of the gels prepared at pH 7 from 13.93 to 22.98 kPa. This is related to the phase separation phenomena produced during heating, which increased the apparent protein concentration. Moreover, inulin formed nanoparticles in the void spaces of the protein network performing a filling effect and creating junction zones. Localized interactions such as hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds were possible between protein and inulin at the borders of junction zones. This research has provided a new approach to make strong oat protein gels at neutral pH. Future applications may promote the utilization of oat protein as a plant derived gelling ingredient in a wide range of food applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"The effects of extrusion temperature, screw speed and specific mechanical energy (SME) on reorganisation of oat components, starch, proteins and lipids, during extrusion of whole oat flour were studied. High SME transformed whole oat flour to a more homogenous matrix. However, based on CLSM images, high SME induced lipid separation from the oat matrix in high screw speeds but not at low extrusion temperatures. Cellular structures were broken and degraded and water solubility of oat components increased. Minimum extrusion temperature of 110 degrees C and screw speed of 200 rpm was needed for complete melting and solubilizing oat starch whereas cell wall polysaccharides were solubilized already at low extrusion temperatures due to high friction. Oat proteins, globulins, were only partially denaturated even in extreme conditions (130 degrees C), but their solubility in water decreased substantially in milder conditions. Furthermore, extrusion inactivated endogenous lipases effectively already in mild extrusion conditions (770 degrees C). Native amylose-lipid complexes were partially destroyed in extrusion.

"Oat protein produced by a dry milling process was enzymatically deamidated by a food-grade protein-glutaminase (PG), and the effects on structure, solubility and emulsifying properties of oat proteins were studied. The reactions were conducted at neutral pH and low salt concentration conditions. Oat proteins were deamidated up to a deamidation degree of 59%. The solubility of proteins doubled. Oil-in-water emulsions prepared with the native and deamidated oat proteins differed as the emulsions prepared from oat proteins with high deamidation degree had a more uniform oil droplet particle size and longer stability. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis demonstrated that oat protein secondary structure became more flexible by deamidation. Protein-glutaminase mediated deamidation appeared to be a promising technique to improve oat protein functionality such as emulsifying ability and solubility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Lipid oxidation of omega-3 fatty acids has posed a serious challenge for incorporating heart-healthy oil products into healthful foods and beverages. In this study, plant and marine based omega-3 oils were dispersed into sodium caseinate dispersions and then mixed with purified heart-healthy oat gum comprised of 97% beta-glucan in a homogenizer under room temperature. The stable emulsions underwent shelf life tests to assess their stabilities and oxidative activities. Various preparations of omega-3 oil-in-water emulsions with 10mL oil/100mLstabilized with sodium caseinate ranging from 0 to 3g caseinate/100g sample and beta-glucan ranging from 0 to 0.3g beta-glucan/100g sample were formed. The physical properties such as creaming index, particle size, and viscosity of the emulsions were measured. The lipid oxidation was measured as lipid hydroperoxide concentration and reduction of lipid oxidation was observed under shelf-life stress tests at 28 degrees C. The fatty acids of the oils were also measured using gas chromatography. Omega-3 fatty acids compositional changes were observed over the shelf life tests. It was found that caseinate helped reduce the oxidation of the oils in general and there is no significant impact of beta-glucan on oxidation. Addition of caseinate and beta-glucan in the emulsions slightly increased both particle size and viscosity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",398,99,1,1,1,99,3,0,0,2,205
"Fibers of beta-glucan have been added to foods for their thickening properties, their ability to form gel at low concentrations, but mainly for their appeal in health promotion. Current analysis evaluates the influence of acetylation (4% and 6% acetic anhydride for 10 and 20 min) on the functional, thermal, morphological and rheological properties of the concentrate containing 31% of oat beta-glucan. The degree of substitution of the acetylated beta-glucans ranged from 0.03 to 0.12, suitable for use in foods. Acetylation increased the heterogeneity of molecule degradation and promoted a more compacted hole-less microstructure. Functional properties such as the swelling power and bile acid binding capacity were increased by acetylation. The beta-glucan gel showed a reduction in hardness and adhesiveness, which was confirmed by its rheological behavior similar to liquid. The above information is relevant to establish the industrial application of acetylated beta-glucan. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",399,99,1,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,149
"The objective of this study was to optimise the incorporation of the vitamin E-enriched palm fat, oat and xanthan gum in gluten-based vegetarian nugget formulation. The effects of these ingredients on the texture, oil, and vitamin E content of the fried nugget formulations were analysed. The formulation was optimised using Response Surface Method (RSM). The vitamin E and oil content in fried nuggets were dependent on the amount of palm fat used in the formulation. Less xanthan gum, and more oat and palm fat resulted in higher oil content in the fried nuggets. Palm fat and xanthan gum significantly influenced the texture of the nuggets. The firmness increased as more oat was added. The optimum combination of these ingredients is 6.4% palm fat, 6.8% xanthan gum and 10% oat. These findings provide a basis in formulating gluten-based nuggets with vitamin E-enriched palm fat.

"The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of solid-state fermentation with Cordyceps militaris SN-18 on major antioxidant components, antioxidant activities and DNA damage protection of oats. Various solvents with different polarities were used to extract antioxidant components and ultra-high performance liquid chromatographic analysis was conducted to determine the major individual phenolic compounds of the oat samples. The results indicated that extraction yields, major phenolic compounds, antioxidant activities and DNA damage protection of oats were significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced by fermentation, and the acetone extract of fermented oats showed the strongest antioxidant activities. Analysis of extraction yields revealed that the bioactive principles associated with DPPH radical and ABTS.(+) scavenging effect, reducing power was most efficiently extracted from fermented oats using water. Additionally, fermented oat extracts demonstrated significantly (p < 0.05) greater protection against oxidative DNA damage than non-fermented samples. There was a strong correlation between the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities. Thus, the present study showed that fermented oats with enhanced antioxidant capacity and DNA damage protection, which can be effective in the prevention of oxidative damage-induced disease, therefore serve as nutraceuticals and functional foods in health promotion.

"The impact of commercial oat or barley beta-glucan concentrates incorporated at different levels (1.3-3.9 % actual beta-glucan concentration, flour basis) into gluten-free (GF) rice-based dough formulations differing in water content (89-141%, flour basis) on dough rheology (empirical and fundamental tests) and breadmaking performance has been investigated. The effect of the baking process on the content and molecular weight of beta-glucan in the final bread has been also evaluated. The rheological properties of the dough were dramatically influenced by dough water content; i.e. optimization of dough hydration is indeed of primary importance on improving GF bread quality. The bread specific volume was negatively correlated with the dough elastic modulus (G') and the viscosity (eta(0)), and positively with the loss tangent. At optimum hydration, the rheological properties of barley beta-glucans-enriched doughs and the quality attributes of breads derived therefrom were notably affected by the soluble fibre content; the G' at 1 Hz increased up to similar to 100% and the bread volume decreased similar to 32% with respect to the values of the control dough and bread. In contrast, the impact of concentration of the oat-beta-glucan preparation in the fortified doughs and bread was much less pronounced. These findings could be explained by the ability of the low molecular weight barley beta-glucans to develop a gel network structure at higher concentrations, whereas the preparation of the high molecular weight oat beta-glucan exhibits a more viscous-like rheological response. The added beta-glucans to doughs were also quantitated in the bread crumbs, and a significant decrease in their molecular weight was noted, most likely due to the beta-glucanase activity in the raw materials incorporated in the GF flour mixtures. Consequently, although the EFSA claims are achievable in gluten-free breads enriched with commercial beta-glucans concentrates, control of beta-glucanase activity in the raw materials may be a critical",402,99,99,0,1,99,1,0,1,3,301
"We hypothesized that ground juniper and dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) fed to lambs would have no negative effects on end products.

Lambs fed control had greater (P < 0.03) shrunk BW and HCW vs. lambs fed 0JUN, but other carcass characteristics and sensory panel traits were similar (P > 023). As juniper increased in the DDGS-based diets, HCW increased quadratically (P = 0.01) and LM fatty acid composition was altered. Feeding juniper did not negatively affect (P > 0.57) off-flavor in chops, but enhanced (linear, P < 0.05) juiciness, tenderness, and flavor intensity.

Male Holstein calves (43.1 +/- 2.3 kg at birth; n = 8, 9, and 7 for trials 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were housed in individual pens in a heated facility; bedding was covered with landscape fabric to prevent consumption of bedding by the calves. In trials 1 and 2 only, calves were fitted with rumen cannulas by wk 2 of life. In all trials, a fixed amount of starter (containing 25% oats either ground and in the pellet or whole) was offered daily; orts were fed through the cannula in trials 1 and 2. Calves were randomly assigned to an all-pelleted starter or pellets plus whole oats. Rumen contents (trials 1 and 2) were sampled weekly at -8, -4, 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after grain feeding for determination of pH and volatile fatty acids. Calves were killed 3 wk (trial 1) or 4 wk (trials 2 and 3) after grain was offered; organs were harvested, emptied, rinsed, and weighed to gauge digestive organ development. Starter intake was not different between treatments. Weekly measurements of rumen digesta pH did not change and only subtle changes were observed in molar proportions of individual volatile fatty acids. Molar proportion of butyrate and pH linearly decreased with age, whereas acetate proportion increased. Reticulorumen weight and papillae length tended to be greater for calves fed pelleted starter, whereas abomasum weight was greater for calves fed pellets plus whole oats. Fecal particle size and starch content were greater for calves fed pellets plus whole oats. Under the conditions of this study, physical form of oats in starter grain did not affect rumen fermentation measurements; greater rumen weight and papillae length in calves fed pelleted starter may be the result of greater nutrient availability of ground oats.

"There is concern that egg intake may increase blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, we have previously shown that eggs reduce inflammation in patients at risk for T2DM, including obese subjects and those with metabolic syndrome. Thus, we hypothesized that egg intake would not alter plasma glucose in T2DM patients when compared to oatmeal intake. Our primary endpoints for this clinical intervention were plasma glucose and the inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin 6 (IL-6). As secondary endpoints, we evaluated additional parameters of glucose metabolism, dyslipidemias, oxidative stress and inflammation. Twenty-nine subjects, 35-65 years with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values <9% were recruited and randomly allocated to consume isocaloric breakfasts containing either one egg/day or 40 g of oatmeal with 472 mL of lactose-free milk/day for five weeks. Following a three-week washout period, subjects were assigned to the alternate breakfast. At the end of each period, we measured all primary and secondary endpoints. Subjects completed four-day dietary recalls and one exercise questionnaire for each breakfast period. There were no significant differences in plasma glucose, our primary endpoint, plasma lipids, lipoprotein size or subfraction concentrations, insulin, HbA1c, apolipoprotein B, oxidized LDL or C-reactive protein. However, after adjusting for gender, age and body mass index, aspartate amino-transferase (AST) (p < 0.05) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (p < 0.01), one of our primary endpoints were significantly reduced during the egg period.

"Oat beta-glucan (OG) is a linear non-starch polysacchride which is usually concentrated in the inner aleurone and subaleurone endosperm cell walls, and it exhibits good physiological and functional properties. In this paper soy protein isolate (SPI) which is widely used in the food industry was mixed with OG, then the gel properties and micromechanism of the mixture were studied for a better understanding of the interaction between beta-glucan and protein in food. The results showed that, compared with the single OG or SPI, OG/SPI mixture easily formed thermoreversible gels in 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C, which reduced the gel forming time; this would be conducive to improve beta-glucans application in food production. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and the thermal stability were increased. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were used to analyze the microstructure of the mixture of OG/SPI, and showed that the gathering and interaction of oat beta-glucan and soy protein isolate affected the forming of gels. The molecular simulations of the microstructure of OG and OG/SPI mixed system inferred the interaction between OG and SPI were mainly hydrogen bonds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Oats is valuable raw material, but it needs to be heat-treated to inactivate lipid degrading enzymes that would deteriorate its sensory quality. The aim was to study if extrusion could replace traditional heat treatment in production of whole meal oats with stable lipids. Flours from non-heat-treated (NHT) oat grains were extruded under four conditions and subjected to 15-week storage. Stability of the extrudates as well as the NHT and heat-treated oat grains were studied for hydrolytic and oxidative reactions by measuring neutral lipid profiles and volatile products. In the NI-IT oat grains, lipid hydrolysis started immediately after milling, which also promoted lipid oxidation during storage. Enzymatic degradation of lipids could effectively be prevented by extrusion even at the lowest temperature of 70 degrees C. The extrusion temperature could be increased to 110 degrees C without subjecting the lipids to non-enzymatic oxidation. However, by increasing the temperature to 130 degrees C, lipid oxidation was promoted, which also resulted in losses of neutral lipids over time. Hexanoic acid became the major volatile product in oat extrudates during extensive lipid oxidation instead of hexanal, which is a commonly used lipid oxidation indicator. In conclusion, lipids in oat grains could be stabilized by extrusion even at a temperature of 70 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",412,99,1,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,215
"When high molecular weight beta-glucan is added to milk, macroscopic phase separation occurs due to thermodynamic incompatibility between mixed-linkage beta-glucan and milk proteins. In this research, the evolution of microphase separated domains was investigated using ultrasonic and diffusing wave spectroscopy. It was possible to follow the dynamics of phase separation, in situ, without dilution. Immediately after mixing, there was a significant decrease in the initial turbidity of the mixtures, measured using diffusing wave spectroscopy, even at concentrations below macroscopic phase separation. At low and intermediate concentrations of beta-glucan (0.1-0.2 w/w) the turbidity parameter, 1/l*, changed after mixing, because of rearrangements within the protein rich domains and growth of the phase separated domains. At high concentrations of beta-glucan (0.6 % w/w), after an initial change in 1/l*, no further changes in turbidity were observed, because of the high viscosity of the mobile phase and the low diffusivity of the micelles due to crowding within the phase separated domains. Similar conclusions were drawn by observing the changes in ultrasonic attenuation, when probing at larger length scales. By using these two spectroscopic techniques it was possible to obtain complementary information on the dynamics of phase separation in beta-glucan milk mixtures, and determine which systems still show rearrangements within the domains after mixing.",413,99,0,99,1,99,1,0,1,3,209
"Functional advantages of probiotics combined with interesting composition of oat were considered as an alternative to dairy products. In this study, fermentation of oat milk with Lactobacillus reuteri and Streptococcus thermophilus was analysed to develop a new probiotic product. Central composite design with response surface methodology was used to analyse the effect of different factors (glucose, fructose, inulin and starters) on the probiotic population in the product. Optimised formulation was characterised throughout storage time at 4? in terms of pH, acidity, -glucan and oligosaccharides contents, colour and rheological behaviour. All formulations studied were adequate to produce fermented foods and minimum dose of each factor was considered as optimum. The selected formulation allowed starters survival above 10(7)/cfu ml to be considered as a functional food and was maintained during the 28 days controlled. -glucans remained in the final product with a positive effect on viscosity. Therefore, a new probiotic non-dairy milk was successfully developed in which high probiotic survivals were assured throughout the typical yoghurt-like shelf life.",414,1,1,99,99,99,2,0,0,3,166
"B-glucan is one of the components that differentiate oats from other cereals and that contribute to the health-related value of oats. However, so far oats cannot easily be applied in bread-like products without loss of product quality. Here we have studied how the content and viscosity of oat beta-glucan affect the technological properties of oat dough in both a gluten-free and a gluten-containing system. In both systems, increasing the beta-glucan concentration resulted in an increase of dough stiffness and in a reduction of dough extensibility. beta-glucan negatively impacted the elastic properties that additional wheat gluten conferred to oat dough. This effect was smaller for medium-viscosity beta-glucan than for high-viscosity beta-glucan. Interestingly, dough made from low beta-glucan flour (<2%) had increased gas retention capacity. Overall, the impact of beta-glucan on the properties of oat dough systems was governed by concentration and viscosity, with or without additional wheat gluten. Our findings indicate that beta-glucan is a key component that determines the rheology of oat-based dough systems and, with that, the technological functionality of oat in dough systems.

"This work reports four TaqMan real-time PCR assays for authenticity testing of wheat, barley, rye and oat species in food and feed. The method uses three specific primer/probe systems targeting DNA fragments from the ITS1 region for the detection of wheat, barley and oats, and a fourth primer/probe system targeting the MIPS gene for rye detection. The real-time PCR systems showed high specificity and sensitivity, achieving relative detection limits ranging from 0.00001 to 0.01% in an experimental flour binary mixture model. The developed technique was further applied at the field level to check the labeling of 270 food and pet food products regarding the presence/absence of wheat, barley, rye and oat cereals. The assay allowed the authentication of foods with different labeling schemes, in which the presence of the targeted cereals was either declared, not declared or declared as possible traces.

"Background: Whole grain consumption reduces the risk of major chronic diseases. It is not clear how whole grains exert their beneficial effects. Objective: The aim was to compare the physiologic effects of whole grain oat (WGO) flour with low bran oat (LBO) flour. Methods: Two AIN-93G-based diets were formulated with either WGO or LBO flour. Five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed LBO (n = 11) and WGO (n = 13) diets for 8 wk. Cecal microbiota was profiled by pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Data are reported as means +/- SEMs or antilogs of the mean (mean - SEM, mean + SEM). Results: The weight gain was 14.6% less in the WGO group during week 7 (P = 0.04). WGO improved insulin sensitivity as reflected by significantly lower plasma insulin [1500 (1370, 1650) ng/L vs. 2340 (2090, 2620) ng/L; P = 0.006], C-peptide (3980 +/- 548 ng/L vs. 7340 +/- 1050 ng/L; P = 0.007), and homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (21.4 +/- 2.3 vs. 34.7 +/- 4.9; P = 0.03). Plasma total cholesterol was 9.9% less and non-HDL cholesterol was 11% less in the WGO group. A comparison of relative abundance indicated Prevotellaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Alcaligenaceae families were 175.5% (P = 0.03), 184.5% (P = 0.01), and 150.0% (P = 0.004), respectively, greater in the WGO group and Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae families were 527% (P = 0.004) and 62.6% (P = 0.01), respectively, greater in the LBO group. Cecal microbiota composition predicts 63.9% variation in plasma insulin and 88.9% variation in plasma non-HDL cholesterol. Conclusions: In mice, WGOs improved insulin sensitivity and plasma cholesterol profile compared with LBOs, and the effects were associated with the changes in cecal microbiota composition. Increasing WGO consumption may help improve insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia in chronic diseases.",417,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,296
"Oats are rich in dietary fibre (DF) especially in beta-glucan which has several health-promoting effects. Oats are not commonly used in extruded snacks because they often result in a poor expansion and hard structure. In the present study, defatted wholegrain oat flour (WF) and defatted endosperm oat flour (EF) were used as starch sources for extrudates. Five differently treated oat bran fractions (untreated, ultra-fine ground, enzymatically hydrolysed and hot water-extracted solubles and residue) were added to EF (10 or 20 %), and their influence on the chemical, textural and structural properties of extrudates was investigated. Extrudates made of WF had a poor expansion (151 %) and hard texture (399 N), whereas EF formed a better expanded (199 %) and less hard product (149 N). Addition of oat bran concentrate (OBC) decreased the expansion (171-176 %) and resulted in a harder texture (200-265 N) compared to that of EF 100 % extrudates. The lower expansion of WF and OBC-enriched extrudates was due to the higher content of insoluble fibre. However, no statistical differences were detected between the untreated, ultra-fine ground and enzyme-hydrolysed OBC. The water-insoluble (WIS-OBC) and water-soluble (WS-OBC) fractions had opposite effects on the EF-based extrudates: 10 % addition of WIS-OBC fraction significantly decreased the expansion (163 %) and increased the hardness (313 N), whereas the addition of WS-OBC (10 or 20 %) enhanced the expansion (218-226 %) and resulted in less hard textures (131-146 N). The soluble fibres and low protein content in WS-OBC fraction were hypothesised to cause the improved expansion and decreased hardness. The results demonstrated that extrudates with acceptable expansion and hardness can be produced with defatted oat endosperm flour and oat bran fractions. However, the water-insoluble bran components had a negative effect on the textural properties of extrudates.",418,0,1,1,99,1,3,0,1,1,293
"The aim of this study was determine suitable conditions for antioxidant extraction from different oat (Avena sativa L.) varieties, specifically naked oat (Tatran), and yellow (Atego), black (Paddock) and white (Fredy) hulled oats.

"Background: Avenanthramides (AVAs), which are found exclusively in oats, may play an important role in anti-inflammation and antiatherogenesis. Although the bioavailability of AVAs has been investigated previously, little is known about their metabolism. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolism of avenanthramide-C (2c), one of the major AVAs, in mice and by the human microbiota, as well as to elucidate the bioactivity of its major metabolites with the goal of finding new exposure markers to precisely reflect oat consumption. Methods: For the mouse study, 10 CF-1 female mice were divided into control (vehicle-treated) and 2c intragastrically treated (200 mg/kg) groups (5 mice/group). Twenty-four-hour urine and fecal samples were collected with use of metabolic cages. For the batch culture incubations, 2c was cultured with fecal slurries obtained from 6 human donors. Incubated samples were collected at various time points (0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h). Metabolites were identified via HPLC with electrochemical detection and LC with electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry. To investigate whether 2c metabolites retain the biological effects of 2c, we compared their effects on the growth of and induction of apoptosis in HCT-116 human colon cancer cells. Results: Eight metabolites were detected from the 2c-treated mouse urine samples. They were identified as 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (M1), dihydrocaffeic acid (M2), caffeic acid (M3), dihydroferulic acid (M4), ferulic acid (M5), dihydroavenanthramide-C (M6), dihydroavenanthramide-B (M7), and avenanthramide-B (M8) via analysis of their MSn (n = 1-3) spectra. We found that the reduction of 2c's C7'-C8' double bond and the cleavage of its amide bond were the major metabolic routes. In the human microbiota study, 2c was converted into M1-M3 and M6. Moreover, interindividual differences in 2c metabolism were observed among the 6 human subjects. Subjects B, C, E, and F could rapidly metabolize 2c to M6, whereas subject D metabolized",420,0,1,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,304
"The colloidal size and charge of oat protein isolate (OPI) at pH 7.2 and 9.0 with/without transglutaminase (TG) treatment were investigated and related to its surface activity at airewater interface. OPI was prepared from defatted oat flour. It was dispersed in water (pH 7.2), or in buffer (pH 9.0) and the soluble fraction (supernatant after centrifugation at 10 000 x g) was used for particle size, zeta-potential and dynamic surface tension measurements. Dispersions were found to be electrostatically stable (zeta-potential > - 35 mV) with average particle sizes of similar to 70 nm at pH 7.2 and similar to 30 nm at pH 9.0. When diluted at pH 7.2, dissociation and re-association of the particles occurred resulting in increased polydispersity and increased size, while at pH 9.0 particle size and zeta-potential were unchanged after dilution. Dynamic surface tension measurements revealed slower adsorption dynamics and higher final surface tension values at pH 9.0 than at pH 7.2. TG-treatment of OPI dispersion resulted in formation of inter-molecular covalent linkages and led to decreased average particle size and increased stability against dilution in OPI dispersions at neutral pH. TG-treated proteins showed increased negative charge at pH 7.2 and resulted in higher surface tension values compared to the untreated samples. The topography images of adsorbed or spread layers of OPI at a/w interface revealed that oat globulins were effectively adsorbed and existed as monomeric particles or formed aggregates at the interface depending on pH.

"Research was undertaken to determine the effects of pH (1.5-12), stabilization time (1-3 h), and shear rate (200-1200 s(-1)) on the apparent viscosity of wholemeal oat flour-water dispersions (10% w/w). Six oat cultivars, with different content of dietary fibre, especially of (1-3) (1-4) beta-D-glucans, were used in this study. The study demonstrated instability of apparent viscosity of wholemeal oat flour dispersions. An increase of viscosity was observed with the increase in stabilization time. The range of viscosity changes was related with the dispersion pH level-the greatest range of changes was noted for dispersion with pH 9.5. Wholemeal oat flour dispersions, irrespective of the pH level, displayed pseudoplastic flow behaviour. A moderate to high significant linear correlations (Pearson, p <= 0.05) existed between the apparent viscosity and the (1-3) (1-4) beta-D-glucans, soluble dietary fibre and total dietary fibre content. Measurements of apparent viscosity of wholemeal oat flour water dispersions can be used for the estimation of particular dietary fibre fractions content, especially of (1-3) (1-4) beta-D glucans. With the application of suitable measurement conditions, the content of (1 -> 3) (1 -> 4) beta-D glucans can be explained by the apparent viscosity of the oat flour dispersion (R-2 = 0.97-0.98).",422,0,1,99,1,99,2,0,1,2,199
"BACKGROUNDOptical sensing is a potential tool to estimate plant N status, but soil water deficits may interefere with forming a clear relationship. A greenhouse study was conducted with oat plants treated with three water regimes and four N levels to determine whether optical sensing could be used to estimate leaf N and relative water content (RWC). RESULTSLeaf N was strongly correlated with reflectance at 550 nm and at around 705 nm, and N treatments caused a red-edge peak shift to lower wavelength. The ratio of the first derivative reflectance at 741-696 nm (FDRE) was identified to be a good estimator of leaf N at jointing (R-2 = 0.90) and heading (R-2 = 0.86) stages across water treatments. Leaf N also had a stronger association with the red-edge position (REP) at both stages (R-2 = 0.83 and 0.78), or with the ratio R4 (R760/R550) at jointing (R-2 = 0.88), than with chlorophyll meter (SPAD) readings. Under water stress, the predictive accuracy of leaf N increased with these reflectance indices, but decreased using SPAD readings. CONCLUSIONThe results indicate that specific reflectance indices of FDRE, REP and R4 may be used for a rapid and non-destructive estimation of oat plant N status over a range of water regimes.

"Muffins were prepared after incorporation of 5, 10, 15 and 20 per cent fibers viz. oat, psyllium and barley and were stored under ambient and refrigeration conditions. A significant increase in weight of muffins was observed with increasing level of fibers incorporation for muffin making. Muffins incorporated with 10 per cent oat, 10 per cent psyllium and 15 per cent barley fibres had more sensory score than the control muffins. A significant decrease in compression force was observed with increasing levels of fibers in flour for muffins making. A significant decrease in the moisture contents of the muffins was observed in both refrigerated and ambient conditions with increasing time. The sample became dry and finally became unacceptable. Water activity of muffins was found higher in the refrigeration condition but there was a non significant variation in water activity of muffins stored at refrigeration conditions.

"In 2008, Health Canada announced it was considering the establishment of maximum levels for ochratoxin A (OTA) in a number of foods, including unprocessed wheat and oats and their products. The Canada drains Council and Canadian National Millers Association initiated a study to measure the variability and distribution among sample test results so that scientifically based sampling plans could be designed to meet regulatory and industry requirements. Twenty lots of oats naturally contaminated with OTA were identified and sampled according to a nested experimental protocol where 16-two kg laboratory samples were taken from each lot, two 100 g test portions were taken from each comminuted laboratory sample, and two aliquots of the extract from each test portion were analysed for OTA by LC. The variance associated with each step of the OTA test procedure were found to be a function of OTA concentration and regression equations were developed to predict the functional relationship. When using the above OTA test procedure on an oat lot at 5 mu g/kg, the sampling, sample preparation, analytical, and total variances were 11.26, 0.10, 0.13 and 11.49, respectively. The 2 kg sampling step accounted for 98.0% (11.26/11.49) of the total variability. The observed OTA distribution among the 16 OTA sample results was found to be positively skewed and the negative binomial distribution was selected to model the OTA distribution among sample test results. The sampling statistics were incorporated into the FAO Mycotoxin Sampling Tool where operating characteristic curves were calculated to predict the chances of rejecting good lots (seller's risk) and accepting bad lots (buyer's risk) for various sampling plan designs.",427,1,99,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,266
"This study developed a synbiotic food through the fermentation of whole oat flour with Lactobacillus plantarum TK9 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis V9. The physicochemical properties, changes in ingredients and peptide molecular weight distributions were determined during the whole oat fermentation. The highest viable counts of the fermented oats were 2.85 x 10(9) CFU g(-1) (L. plantarum TK9) and 3.17 x 10(8) CFU g(-1) (Bif. animalis subsp. lactis V9), with the titratable acidity increased to 10.01 and 8.40 mL at the end of the fermentation. By comparing the nutrition compositions between the fermented and non-fermented oat flour, we found that there was almost no change in the soluble dietary fiber and beta-glucan content. However, the amounts of free amino nitrogen increased from 110.84 to 154.62 mg per 100 g (L. plantarum TK9) and 82.16 to 104.83 mg per 100 g (Bif. animalis subsp. lactis V9). The levels of oat peptides with molecular weights less than 6000 Da increased by 4.4 and 5.96%, respectively.

"Background: None of the studies of whole grains that have looked either at diet or weight/adiposity measures have focused exclusively on oatmeal. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the association between oatmeal consumption and nutrient intake, diet quality, and weight/adiposity of children aged 2-18. Design: A nationally representative sample of children aged 2-18 (N = 14,690) participating in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2010 was used. Intake was determined from a single 24-h dietary recall. Diet quality was measured using the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010). Covariate-adjusted regression analyses, using appropriate sample weights, were used to determine differences between oatmeal consumers and non-consumers for demographics, nutrient intakes, diet quality, and weight/adiposity measures (p < 0.01). Logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios for weight measures and obesity (p < 0.05). Results: Compared to non-consumers, oatmeal consumers were more likely to be younger and less likely to be smokers. Consumers had higher intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, copper, and potassium, and significantly lower intakes of total, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, cholesterol, and sodium. Oatmeal consumers had higher dietary quality scores attributable to higher intakes of whole grains and lower intakes of refined grains and empty calories. Children consuming oatmeal were at lower risk for having central adiposity and being obese. Conclusions: Consumption of oatmeal by children was associated with better nutrient intake, diet quality, and reduced risk for central adiposity and obesity and should be encouraged as part of an overall healthful diet.",429,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,254

The compound central rotating design was used with treatments containing fixed levels of inulin (5%) and oat fiber (1%) and variable levels of wheat fiber (0-4%) and pork back fat (0-10%). The pH and protein were similar in all the treatments, the fat was lower than the control treatment and the moisture content was higher than the control treatment (CF) without fibers. The wheat fiber increased the hardness and reduced cohesiveness and scores were given for overall impression. We found that it was possible to prepare low-fat bologna sausage with the addition of 6.58% fiber (5% inulin, 1% oat fiber and 0.58% wheat fiber), whilst retaining good sensory acceptability, thus reducing the pork back fat levels by between 25 and 42.75%.",430,1,1,1,99,99,3,0,0,2,147

"Purpose: The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of low and high molecular weight beta-glucans on the chosen immunological parameters, markers of antioxidative potential in rats' colon tissue, the number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in rats' faeces. Methods: The experiment was carried out on 72 8-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats: control (n = 36) and experimental (n = 36). In half of the animals from each group enteritis was induced by LPS (10 mg kg(-1)). Rats from the experimental group were divided into two groups receiving high (GI) or low (GII) molecular weight beta-glucans for 6 consecutive weeks. Results: LPS evoked enteritis in all the treated animals, manifested by changes in the levels of IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-alpha, as well as in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) in the colon tissue. Dietary supplementation with beta-glucans following LPS treatment partially reversed this effect. The changes in SCFA concentration were noted, indicating an improvement of the fermentation process in the colon. This effect coincided with an increased number of LAB, pointing at the prebiotic properties of beta-glucans. The positive influence of beta-glucans was also manifested by the improved values of antioxidative potential markers (TAS, SOD, GR and GPx activity, TBARS concentration), noted especially in rats with LPS-induced enteritis. This influence was more pronounced in the case of low molecular weight oat beta-glucan (GII). Conclusions: The present study showed a positive effect of beta-glucans, especially the low molecular weight form, on the colon tissue of healthy rats, as well as animals with LPS-induced enteritis.",434,1,-1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,270

To correct for the skewed distribution of DON values and avoid nonlinearities in the model, the DON values were transformed as DON* = [log(DON)](3). The model was optimized by cross-validation, and its prediction performance was validated by predicting DON* values for a separate set of validation kernels. The PLSR model and linear discriminant analysis classification were further used on single-pixel spectra to investigate the spatial distribution of infection in the kernels. There were clear differences between the kernel classes. The first component separated the uninoculated and asymptomatic from the severely damaged kernels. Infected kernels showed higher intensities at 1,925, 2,070, and 2,140 nm, whereas noninfected kernels were dominated by signals at 1,400, 1,626, and 1,850 nm. The DON* values of the validation kernels were estimated by using their average spectra, and the correlation (R) between predicted and measured DON* was 0.8. Our results show that HSI has great potential in detecting Fusarium damage and predicting DON in oats, but it needs more work to develop a model for routine application.",436,0,1,1,99,99,2,0,1,2,246
"Objective: The extent to which different types of breakfasts affect appetite and food intake is unclear. To assess the satiety effects of a high-fiber cereal, we compared oatmeal, isocaloric corn flakes, and water. Subjects/Methods: Thirty-six subjects (18 lean, 18 overweight) were assigned to three conditions in a randomized sequence on different days. Ratings of hunger and fullness were obtained concurrently with blood samples for measuring concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon, leptin, and acetaminophen (gastric emptying tracer). Appetite was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) for fullness and hunger, and by measuring food intake of an ad libitum lunch meal at 180 min. Results: Lunch meal intake was lowest after consuming oatmeal (p < 0.00001), which was lower for overweight subjects than lean subjects (p = 0.007). Fullness AUC was greatest (p = 0.00001), and hunger AUC lowest (p < 0.001) after consuming oatmeal. At 180 min, blood glucose was lowest after the corn flakes (p = 0.0001). Insulin AUC was greater for both cereals than water (p < 0.00001). Leptin AUC and glucagon AUC values did not differ between conditions. Acetaminophen concentrations peaked latest after consuming oatmeal (p = 0.046), reflecting slower gastric emptying. Conclusions: Satiety was greater and ad libitum test meal intake lower after consuming oatmeal than after corn flakes, especially in the overweight subjects. (C) 2015 S.

"Ulcerative colitis is a major inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), characterized by inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract through chronic or relapsing immune system activation. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential protective effect of oat beta-glucan (beta G) against colitis induced by DSS in mice. Eighty mice were randomly divided into the control group (no DSS, no beta G), DSS group (DSS only), DSS + L-beta G group (DSS plus 500 mg per kg beta G), and DSS + H-beta G group (DSS plus 1000 mg per kg beta G). Compared with the DSS group, administration of beta G significantly reduced clinical symptoms with less weight loss, diarrhea and shortening of the colon, the severity of colitis was significantly inhibited as evidenced by the reduced disease activity index (DAI) and degree of histological damage in colon. Moreover, treatment with beta G not only decreased myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), and nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, but also inhibited mRNA and protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and iNOS. This suggests that oat beta G in diet might exhibit an anti-inflammatory function against colitis through inhibition of expression of pro-inflammatory factors.",438,1,1,99,1,0,3,0,1,1,197
"Bread was prepared using composite wholegrain flour blend comprising wheat, oats, quality protein maize (QPM) and soybean. Central composite rotatable design (CCRD) with three independent variables oat flour, QPM flour and soybean flour at five levels and four dependent variables, i.e. specific volume, loaf height, crumb firmness and overall acceptability scores, were used to conduct the experiments. Highly acceptable composite bread was obtained by combining optimized level of ingredients with whole wheat flour to make a blend of 100 g. The optimized level of ingredients was oat flour 10.00 g, QPM flour 10.00 g and soybean flour 5.375 g per 100 g flour with 81.5% desirability. The resultant bread had high, protein content, crude fibre and overall acceptability.

"Information on the antioxidant activity of oat avenanthramides is available but not in relation to other prospective biological activities. Data on the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-itch, anti-irritant and antiatherogenic activities of avenanthramides have been previously published. In the present study, surprisingly, mild inhibitory activity of avenanthramide A on thrombin, trypsin, plasmin and papain was detected. Avenanthramide B was shown to inhibit chymotrypsin and pepsin activities, while avenanthramide C was found to strongly inhibit chymotrypsin activity and moderately trypsin activity.

"Consumption of breads containing whole grains or functional ingredients rich in dietary fiber and beta-glucans has shown a dramatic increase because of their health benefits. Since bioactivity of beta-glucan has been linked with its physicochemical properties, the current study was designed to investigate the effects of straight-, sponge- and sour-dough bread making processes on physicochemical characteristics of beta-glucan in whole wheat/oat bread. The presence of beta-glucan-degrading enzymes in the whole wheat flour used in this study were found to depolymerize beta-glucan at a rate of 0.054 min(-1), causing a significant reduction in beta-glucan molecular weight (M-w) during dough process. Sour- and sponge-doughs had lower rates of beta-glucan depolymerization, resulting in breads with medium to high beta-glucan M-w range (600-1087 kg/mol) compared to straight-dough method. Dough pH, titratable acidity and fermentation plus proofing time showed significant impacts on beta-glucan M-w and viscosity, but not on solubility. Acetic and propionic acids were present in all doughs, whereas lactic acid was only found in sour-dough. Generally, sour-dough bread showed better potential over yeast-fermented breads in terms of preserving beta-glucan M-w and viscosity during baking process when a blend of whole wheat flour and oat bran was used.

"Purpose - This study aims to evaluate the effect of oat meal on the quality characteristics of restructured spent hen meat blocks. Spent hen meat is considered as poor because of comparatively higher toughness and less juiciness. Design/methodology/approach - Oat meal (1:1 hydration, w/w) was incorporated at the levels of 4, 6 and 8 per cent by replacing the lean meat in prestandardized restructured spent hen meat blocks formulation and assessed for physico-chemical and sensory quality. Findings - The product yield and pH of restructured spent hen meat blocks (RSHMB) were significantly higher at 8 per cent oat meal as compared to control. Shear force values of RSHMB with various levels of oat meal incorporation were significantly lower than control. There were no significant differences in the general appearance, texture, binding, juiciness and overall acceptability scores of RSHMB with different levels of oat meal and control. However, there was a marginal increase in binding and juiciness of RSHMB with increase in the level of oat meal. The optimum incorporation level of oat meal in RSHMB was adjudged as 8 per cent, which also resulted in reduction of production cost by Rs. 14.4/kg as compared to control. Research limitations/implications - The trials can be further carried to evaluate the storage stability of developed RSHMB. Originality/value - The paper has demonstrated potential of oat meal as an extender in the development of RSHMB, which also reduced the cost of production.",442,99,99,1,99,1,2,0,0,3,238
"The curcuminoid-carrying potential of oat fiber was examined as a potential route to overcome the low aqueous solubility of curcuminoids. Aqueous dispersions of oat fiber were mixed with curcuminoids solubilized in ethanol to obtain curcuminoids-oat fiber (1% w/w) dispersions in aqueous ethanol (2% v/v). Centrifugation of the curcuminoids-oat fiber dispersions resulted in a supernatant (95.3% w/w: 0.11% w/w protein, 0.17% w/w b-glucan) and precipitate (4.74% w/w: 0.18% w/w protein, 0.11% w/w beta-glucan) with the curcuminoids being almost equally partitioned into both fractions. Curcuminoids solubility in the supernatant was markedly greater than that in aqueous ethanol and water. The curcuminoids were in the amorphous state in the precipitated fraction and were more stable to degradation than the curcuminoids in the supernatant.

"An amphiphilic fatty acid oat beta-glucan ester (FAOGE) was first synthesized, and its structure-curcumin loading capacity (CLC) relationship was investigated. The DS of product increased with the addition of acyl imidazole, decreased with Mw of beta-glucan, and did not relate to the acyl chain length. Characterizations by FT-IR and H-1 NMR evidenced the presence of ester groups in FAOGE and confirmed its successful synthesis. The aqueous self-aggregation behavior of FAOGE was revealed by transmission electron microcopy and dynamic light scattering. With the aid of response surface methodology, a quadratic polynomial equation was obtained to quantitatively describe the structure-CLC relationship of FAOGE by using M-w of beta-glucan, acyl chain length, and DS as variables. The CLC increased with Mw of beta-glucan and acyl chain length but maximized at a medium DS. The maximum CLC value was obtained as 4.05 mu g/mg.

"Background: The aim of present study is to investigate the hypocholesterolemic effects of the oat components other than the beta-glucan in rats fed with a hypercholesterolemic diet. Methods: Four-week-old male Wister rats were divided into 6 groups of 7 rats each with similar mean body weights and serum cholesterol concentrations. Rats were fed with the experimental diets containing 10% oats flour for 30 days. Food intake was recorded and monitored everyday to ensure the similar contents of protein, starch, lipid and cellulose in all groups. The lipids levels in serum, liver, and faeces were determined. Results: The plasma total cholesterol concentrations in different oat groups were significantly reduced compared with the control group, and the effects were different among oat groups. The decrease extent of plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations increased with the increase of the proteins and lipids contents. Moreover, liver total cholesterol and cholesterol ester contents were markedly decreased. The fecal bile acids concentrations in the oat groups were significantly increased. Oat proteins had lower Lysine/Arginin (0.59 similar to 0.66) and Methionin/Glycine (0.27 similar to 0.35) ratio than casein (Lysine/Arginin, 2.33; Methionin/Glycine, 1.51). Oat lipids contained higher contents of total Vitamin E and plant sterols than that in soybean oil. Conclusion: These results indicated that dietary oat improved hypercholesterolemia by increasing the excretions of fecal bile acids, and this improvement was not only related to beta-glucan, but also attributed to the lipids and proteins. Oat proteins decreased serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol contents due to their low Lysine/Arginin and Methionin/Glycine ratio. The co-existence of oleic acid, linoleic, vitamin E, or plant sterols accounted for the hypocholesterolemic properties of oat lipids.",445,0,1,99,1,1,3,0,1,1,275
"Avenanthramides are characteristic constituents of oat seeds. We analyzed the methanol extract of oat seeds by HPLC and detected three compounds 1, 2, and 3 eluted at retention times similar to avenanthramides. The three compounds were purified by column chromatography and HPLC. Spectroscopic analyses of 1, 2, and 3 suggested that they are amides of 4,5-dihydroxyanthranilic acid with caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids, respectively. Their identities were confirmed by comparing spectra and chromatographic behavior with compounds synthesized from 4,5-dihydroxyanthranilic acid and N-hyrdroxysuccinimide esters of hydroxycinnamic acids. LC-MS/MS analysis with multiple reaction monitoring showed that the amounts of 1, 2, and 3 were 16.5-26.9% of corresponding avenanthamides with 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid.

"Electrostatic separation was studied in a city fractionation diagram to obtain beta-glucan-enriched fractions from oat bran preparations. Ultra-fine grinding at ambient or cryogenic temperature was needed to achieve good dissociation between the macronutrients of oat bran particles. Particles rich in beta-glucan and starch were by electrostatic separation separated from particles rich in arabinoxylan. beta-Glucan was only little enriched in the non-defatted bran fractions from 19.6 to 25.0%. In contrast preliminary defatting by super critical carbon dioxide significantly improved the dissociation of particles during grinding and allowed enrichment of beta-glucan to 42.2 or 48.4% after one or two successive electrostatic separation steps. The twice separated positive fraction, containing 48.4% beta-glucan, was further fractionated by a combination of jet-milling and air classification, yielding up to 56.2% beta-glucan concentration. The results point out the good potential of using electrostatic separation as a bran-fractionation method to produce nutritionally interesting food ingredients. Industrial relevance: Oat beta-glucan has a widely accepted health claim related to cholesterol lowering, and has a great industrial applicability in functional foods and nutraceuticals. The high concentrations of beta-glucan obtained with defatted material are of major interest from an industrial point of view, since this kind of ingredients can be used in applications where normal oat bran preparations cannot provide beta-glucan at high enough concentration. In addition, the obtained beta-glucan fractions retained their original molecular weight The high beta-glucan fractions had an appealing white colour and were well solubilised in hot water and in 0.1 M NaOH compared to their low beta-glucan counter-fractions.

"Background: Health claims regarding the cholesterol-lowering effect of soluble fiber from oat products, approved by food standards agencies worldwide, are based on a diet containing >= 3 g/d of oat beta-glucan (OBG). Given the number of recently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is important to update the findings of previous meta-analyses. Objective: The objective was to quantify the effect of >= 3 g OBG/d on serum cholesterol concentrations in humans and investigate potential effect modifiers. Design: A meta-analysis was performed on 28 RCTs comparing g OBG/d with an appropriate control. Systematic searches were undertaken in PubMed, AGRICOLA, and Scopus between 1 January 1966 and 6 June 2013, plus in-house study reports at CreaNutrition AG. Studies were assessed with regard to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and data were extracted from included studies by reviewers working independently in pairs, reconciling differences by consensus. Estimates of the mean reduction in serum cholesterol from baseline between the OBG and control diets were analyzed by using random-effects meta-analysis models and meta-regression. Results: OBG in doses of g/d reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol relative to control by 0.25 mmol/L (95% Cl: 0.20, 0.30; P < 0.0001) and 0.30 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.24, 0.35; P < 0.0001), respectively, with some indication of heterogeneity (P = 0.13 and P = 0.067). There was no significant effect of OBG on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides and no evidence that dose (range across trials: 3.0-12.4 g/d) or duration of treatment (range: 2-12 wk) influenced the results. LDL cholesterol lowering was significantly greater with higher baseline LDL cholesterol. There was a significantly greater effect for both LDL and total cholesterol in subjects with diabetes compared with those without (although based on few studies).

"Muffins are a popular snack consumed in western and emerging countries. Increased glycemic load has been implicated in the aetiology of diabetes. This study examined the starch digestibility of muffins baked with rice, wheat, corn, oat and barley flour. Rapidly digested starch (RDS) was greatest in rice (445 mg/g) and wheat (444 mg/g) muffins, followed by oat (416 mg/g), corn (402 mg/g) and barley (387 mg/g). Total phenolic content was found to be positively correlated with total antioxidative capacity and inversely related to the RDS of muffins. The phenolic content was highest in muffin baked with barley flour (1687 mu g/g), followed by corn (1454 mu g/g), oat (945 mu g/g), wheat (705 mu g/g), and rice (675 mu g/g) flour. Browning was shown not to correlate with free radical scavenging capacity and digestibility of muffins.

"Incorporation of high molecular weight oat beta-glucan into milk to obtain calorie-reduced and cholesterol-lowering dairy products is challenged by the thermodynamic incompatibility and phase separation of milk proteins and beta-glucan. Fine tuning the concentrations of the biopolymers in the mixture may result in dairy matrices with unique structure and texture. The thermodynamic incompatibility behaviour may follow Asakura and Oosawa (1958) theory for depletion interactions between non-interacting polysaccharides and colloidal hard spheres. A phase behaviour diagram was developed to describe the separation of the mixtures into a protein-rich (lower) and a beta-glucan-rich (upper) phase, but unlike previous literature, the concentration of lactose and ions in the soluble phase was kept constant. Analysis of the protein composition in the lower phase demonstrated that whey proteins did not play a role in phase separation. The experimental phase boundary agreed well with the phase boundary calculated using Vrij's theory (1976) for mixtures of beta-glucan and casein micelles demonstrating that phase separation was driven by depletion interactions. Confocal images showed the formation of different structures (droplet-like or bi-continuous) at different points of the phase behaviour diagram. The flow behaviour of the mixtures with concentrations higher than the binodal curve was not only governed by the presence of beta-glucan chains, but also by the formation of these structures.

"Background: The blood glucose-lowering effects of beta-glucan from oats and barley depend on the amounts consumed and their rheological properties. This has been recently challenged with growing evidence that the food matrix may also be an important factor in predicting its physiological response. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of varying doses of beta-glucan from oats and barley and added to a snack bar on postprandial glycemia. Design: In a randomized crossover study, 12 healthy males and females consumed one of 8 snack bars containing 0 (control), 1.5, 3, and 6g of beta-glucan derived from oats or barley or 3 white bread controls. All treatments contained 50g of available carbohydrate. Blood glucose concentrations were measured after ingestion of the treatments over 2hours. Results: Incorporation of 1.5 to 6g of beta-glucan into snack bars had no additional glucose-lowering benefits irrespective of dose and source compared to the control bars (0g beta-glucan), suggesting that both the solid food matrix and composition of the bars may play a role in their effects on glycemic response. All bars reduced blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) by an average of 25% (p < 0.05) compared to the mean of the 3 white bread controls.

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of process called micronization, applied during preparation of beta-glucan concentrate, on properties of residual oats flour, and respective starch. The properties of residual oats flour (ROF) and starch isolated from this material (ROS) were compared with commercial flours: oats (COF) and wheat (CWF), and the respective starches (COS and CWS). It was shown, that micronization caused changes in starch fraction. Starch granules present in ROF not occur in clusters, and were only slightly damaged, which had no influence on molar mass of starch glucans, as well as on swelling and pasting properties of starch and mechanical modulus at linear viscoelasticity range. It was observed that flour pasting properties are determined not only by starch properties but also the presence other flour constituents (lipids, soluble and insoluble protein fractions, and to slightly lesser degree the content of beta - glucans).

"The effect of milling degree in three oat cultivars was determined to illustrate the milling characteristics as well as the distribution of phytic acid and some nutritional components in oats. According to the results, to obtain the same milling degree (12%), Baiyan2 (naked oat) required the longest milling (60 s), while Linna (hulled oat) and Bayou1 (naked oat) required shorter milling of 50 s. The milling process could effectively decrease the level of phytic acid, whose distribution was found to be uneven and highly concentrated in the oat bran (27%-53% phytic acid). As for the content of phytic acid in oat, Bayou1 showed a much higher value (52.92 +/- 10.27%) in oat bran than Baiyan2 (31.38 +/- 031%) and Linna (27.81 +/- 4.62%). Generally, it took 50-60 s to remove oat bran by milling, which resulted in a 19.7% decrease in hardness of cooked oat.

"Allelopathy is a biological phenomenon in which an organism produces one or more biochemicals that influence the growth, survival, and reproduction of other organisms. Allelopathy has been the subject of a great deal of research in chemical ecology since the 1930s. The characterization of the factors that influence this phenomenon has barely been explored, mainly due to the complexity of this area. The main aim of the research carried out to date has been to shed light on the importance of these interactions in agroecosystems, especially in relation to the interactions between crops and weeds. Herein we report the characterization of a complete allelochemical pathway involving benzoxazinones, which are known to participate in allelopathic plant defense interactions of several plants of high agronomic interest. The production of the defense chemicals by a donor plant (crop), the route and transformations of the chemicals released into the environment, and the uptake and phytotoxic effects on a target plant (weed) were all monitored.

"Chia-oat dry blended composites and their processed hydrocolloids containing 3 and 6 fatty acids from chia along with soluble -glucan from three oat products were developed and studied. Chia's 3 fatty acids and soluble -glucan from oat products are recognized for preventing heart disease.

The pasting property measurement by a Rapid Visco Analyzer and water-holding capacity (WHC) evaluation provided useful information on their interesting physical properties. P-S-D and P-J-S-D products gave unexpectedly low viscosities compared with DBC.

The unique chemical and physical properties of oats and physiological responses to oat consumption contribute to their demonstrated health benefits; other health attributes are still under evaluation. Many of these benefits, such as those associated with a reduced risk of CVD, are codified in health claims by several regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the USA and the European Food Safety Authority in Europe. Despite these oat-health relationships, an apparent decline in agricultural production, the presence of an array of plant pathogens, and dynamics of climatic conditions may preclude the availability and subsequent consumption of this commodity worldwide. Therefore, it is incumbent on scientists from multiple disciplines to advance research in a spectrum of arenas, including physico-chemical properties of oats, the impact of oats on an array of non-communicable diseases and human microbiome, agricultural practices and environments, and processing technologies that contribute to global food policies.",461,1,1,1,-1,1,4,1,0,0,190
"Oats are a uniquely nutritious food as they contain an excellent lipid profile and high amounts of soluble fibre. However, an oat kernel is largely non-digestible and thus must be utilised in milled form to reap its nutritional benefits. Milling is made up of numerous steps, the most important being dehulling to expose the digestible groat, heat processing to inactivate enzymes that cause rancidity, and cutting, rolling or grinding to convert the groat into a product that can be used directly in oatmeal or can be used as a food ingredient in products such as bread, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and snack bars. Oats can also be processed into oat bran and fibre to obtain high-fibre-containing fractions that can be used in a variety of food products.",462,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,126
"The gut microbiota plays important roles in proper gut function and can contribute to or help prevent disease. Whole grains, including oats, constitute important sources of nutrients for the gut microbiota and contribute to a healthy gut microbiome. In particular, whole grains provide NSP and resistant starch, unsaturated TAG and complex lipids, and phenolics. The composition of these constituents is unique in oats compared with other whole grains. Therefore, oats may contribute distinctive effects on gut health relative to other grains. Studies designed to determine these effects may uncover new human-health benefits of oat consumption.",463,1,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,95
"Oats are undervalued in comparison with wheat, rice and barley, despite their unique composition that includes many of the nutrients required for health and a reduced risk of degenerative disease incidence. Furthermore, oats as whole grain and some of their associated products also contain beta-glucan, a complex polysaccharide that has an approved health claim to reduce blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of CHD incidence if consumed at >= 3 g/d. At the agronomic level, oats exhibit optimal growth in regions of moderate temperature and long day length. In addition, they can tolerate wet weather and acidic soils more effectively than other cereals, such as wheat. Studies have shown that there is diversity in the content and composition of nutrients and health-beneficial components within the available wild and cultivated germplasm and that these are amenable to be enhanced by different agronomic practices as well as are susceptible to climatic variation. The advances in modern plant genetics, developed in sister cereals such as wheat, rice and barley, mean that oat development and exploitation should see an acceleration in the coming decade as they are adopted and applied. These advances include approaches such as genome sequencing, genotyping by sequencing and the allied next-level analytical approaches of RNA sequencing, transcriptome profiling and metabolomics. The collation and coordination of these approaches should lead to the generation of new, tailored oat varieties that are nutritionally enhanced and contain a greater proportion of health-beneficial components that can be translated through into a wide(r) range of consumer products with the ultimate hope of associated benefits to human health and nutrition.",464,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,264
"The water-soluble, mixed-linkage beta-glucan, a form of soluble dietary fibre, is considered the main biologically active component responsible for the capacity of many oat products to lower postprandial glycaemia and fasting plasma cholesterol in human subjects. The present review discusses the physical and chemical properties of oat beta-glucan that are considered important predictors of these beneficial metabolic effects. In vitro modelling and animal and human studies have provided compelling evidence showing that the ability of oat beta-glucan to increase the viscosity of digesta in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a primary determinant of its blood-glucose and cholesterol-lowering properties. Therefore, the chemical structure, molecular weight (MW), the rate and extent of dissolution and solution rheology of oat beta-glucan are key factors in determining the physiological function of oat-containing foods. The structure and properties of oat beta-glucan vary between species and varieties of oats, and are also affected by the growing and storage conditions and processing of oat grain. In addition, the extraction and analysis methods may also contribute to the variations in the structure, MW, hydration and solution rheology of beta-glucan obtained from different laboratories. Recent work has demonstrated that beta-glucan solubility in foods depends on the source of the material and processing conditions; solubility may also be subject to changes during food preparation and storage (such as freezing). In conclusion, both the amount and MWof beta-glucan that are solubilised in the GIT need to be considered when assessing the blood-glucose and cholesterol-lowering properties of oat-containing foods.",465,0,1,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,246
"The shelf-life of plain oatcakes and oatcakes containing a natural antioxidant (rosemary extract) was studied for 28 weeks. The biscuits were evaluated using several chemical analyses to determine oxidation (headspace analysis, free fatty acids profile, peroxide value and anisidine value), in addition to sensory testing. A selection of volatiles, including hexanal, were found to be positively correlated to three sensory parameters (aroma, flavour and aftertaste). These volatiles, responsible for the perception of off-flavour in oat biscuits, were predominantly secondary lipid breakdown products, primarily from the unsaturated fatty acids C18:1 and C18:2. The peroxide value was also found to be a useful tool to assess oxidation in oatcakes. The impact of the antioxidant was insufficient at the concentration tested to be used as a solution to prevent the development of off-flavour; however the antioxidant did appear to slow down the rancidity process.

"To better understand mechanisms underlying the health benefits of oats, the free radical scavenging capacities of oat avenanthramides 2c, 2f, and 2p and their ability to inhibit NF-kappa B activation were evaluated. The antioxidant capacities of 2c, 2f, and 2p against peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anion, singlet oxygen, and peroxynitrite were determined by using ORAC, HORAC, SORAC, SOAC, and NORAC assays, respectively. The total antioxidant capacity of 2c was approximately 1.5-fold those of 2f and 2p. Total antioxidant capacity was primarily attributable to SORAC and ORAC for 2c (>77%, p < 0.05), and to ORAC and SOAC for 2f. ORAC accounted for approximately 32% of total antioxidant capacity in 2p. EC50 values for inhibiting TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa B activation in C2C12 cells were 64.3, 29.3, and 9.10 mu M for 2c, 2f, and 2p, respectively. Differences in antioxidant capacities and ability to inhibit NF-kappa B among the avenanthramides could be ascribed to structural variations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Tempeh is a popular traditional fermented food in Asia. Many tempeh-like foods are made from cereal grains. However, the information of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) accumulation in those tempeh-like cereal grains during fermentation is lacking. Meanwhile, little information is available on the anti-nutrient contents and antioxidant activity of tempeh-like fermented oats. The aim of the present work was to study the changes of GABA, phytate, natural antioxidants and antioxidant activity of tempeh-like fermented oats. As fermentation time progressed, the GABA, total phenolics content (TPC) and flavonoids increased rapidly. The Aspergillus oryzae-fermented oats had the highest GABA, whereas Rhizopus oryzae-fermented oats had the highest TPC. Phytate, an anti-nutrient component, was dramatically reduced in the fermented oats, especially those by A. oryzae (reduced by about 63 %). The antioxidant activities of fermented oats were also significantly enhanced after 72 h fermentation (p < 0.05). This study demonstrated that oats fermented by generally recognized as safe (GRAS) fungi can be recommended as tempeh-like functional foods with higher GABA, more natural antioxidants and lower phytate compared with native oats.",468,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,174
"Oats are generally considered as a health food and widely accepted by human beings nowadays. Oat flakes are the main commercial oat products around the world. In order to understand the chemical composition and sensory characteristics of the naked oat flakes from China and the hulled oat flakes from western countries, 37 flake samples from China and 44 samples from western countries (8 from the USA, 8 from Canada, 5 from Sweden, 8 from Denmark, 7 from the United Kingdom, and 8 from New Zealand) were investigated in the present study. The results indicated that naked oat flakes showed significantly higher (P < 0.01) contents of lipid and Na, a higher level of whiteness (P < 0.05) and lower (P < 0.01) contents of beta-glucan and Fe, compared to hulled oat flakes from western countries. No significant differences of Zn, Ca, and total ash contents were observed between naked oat flakes and hulled oat flakes. In addition, naked oat flakes showed significantly higher water absorption index at room temperature (P < 0.01) when compared with hulled oat flakes. Hulled oat flakes showed higher sensory evaluation score than naked oat flakes (P < 0.01). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",469,99,0,99,99,1,1,0,1,3,200
"A modified wet method was developed to fractionate ground oat groats into 4 fractions enriched with beta-glucan (BG), protein, starch, and other carbohydrates (CHO), respectively. Effects of defatting oats and centrifuge force for separation were also investigated. Results show that, depending on the two factors, nutrient concentrations in the corresponding fractions ranged 28.53-44.84% (dry matter) for BG, 72.41-92.62% for protein, 79.13-81.69% for starch, and 37.47-42.16% for other CHO. Nutrient recoveries from each fraction were 39.82-51.20% for BG, 60.36-72.08% for protein, 77.04-87.25% for starch, and 24.87-29.68% for other CHO. For the protein fraction, defatting improved the protein content but did not on its recovery. For the starch fraction, the effect of defatting was just opposite, improving the starch recovery but not the starch content. Centrifuge force increased the BG content in the BG fraction when the defatted sample was used. The cumulative recovery of each component in the combined fractions was not affected by oil removal or centrifuge force. Overall, the wet method described was relatively effective in recovering the major nutrients from oats into their respective fractions, while it alleviated the problems of viscous slurry upon mixing ground oat groats with an alkaline solvent and the difficulty of slurry separation.

"One of the variety of oat, UPO 94 was processed by two simple processing techniques. One method is malting and other is roasting. Malted and roasted oat flour as well as weaning mixes prepared from these two processed flour were analyzed for their nutrient composition, alpha amylase activity and in-vitro protein digestibility. For making weaning mix, oat flour, wheat flour, green gram and skim milk powder were taken in a ratio of 30:30:25:15 respectively. Higher moisture, ash, crude fat, energy, amylase activity, and in-vitro protein digestibility were reported in malted oat flour and weaning mix prepared from malted flour. The minerals, calcium (180.0 mg/100 g) and iron (7.9 mg/100 g) were also higher in malted weaning mix as compared to roasted weaning mix.

"Oats (Avena sativa L.), which are used in foods, are a potential economically viable source of oil. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficiency of oats oil to alleviate oxidative damage of testis induced by deltamethrin, which is a pyrethroid pesticide that exerts a wide range of effects on non-targeted organisms. The reprotoxicity caused by orally administered deltamethrin (DEL) to mice can be effectively antagonized by the beneficial effects of oats oil (OO) as an antioxidant. Thirty-two male albino mice were divided into four equal groups: a control group, a group of mice given deltamethrin (5 mg per kg b.w.), a group administered deltamethrin after receiving oats oil (6 g per kg b.w.), and a group receiving only OO. Exposure to deltamethrin at a dose of 5 mg per kg b.w. per day caused oxidative stress in testis, proven by a decrease in the epididymal sperm count and motility, an increase in the number of abnormal morphologies in spermatozoa and a significant increase of lipid peroxidation (LP) in the testis when compared to control animals. Co-administration of oats oil to the DEL-treated mice ameliorated the testicular biochemical parameters as well as the histological impairments in testis. We concluded that oats oil ameliorated the toxic effects of deltamethrin in testis explored by reduced LP and improved total sperm density, motility and morphology in mice spermatozoa, suggesting its role as a potential antioxidant.",472,99,1,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,234
"This study aimed at investigating the suitability of oat flakes for making functional beverages. Different technological options were assayed, including the amount of flakes, the inoculum of the starter and the addition of enzyme preparations. The beverage containing 25% (wt/wt) of oat flakes and fermented with L. plantarum LP09 was considered optimal on the basis of sensory and technological properties. The enzyme addition favored the growth of the starter, shortened the time needed to reach pH 4.2 to ca. 8 h, and favored a decrease of the quotient of fermentation. Fermentation increased the polyphenols availability and the antioxidant activity (25 and 70% higher, respectively) and decreased the hydrolysis index in vitro. Sensory analyses showed that fermented oat flakes beverage had the typical features of a yogurt-like beverage, enhancing the overall intensity of odor and flavor compared to the non-fermented control. Selection of proper processing and fermentation condition allowed the obtainment of a beverage with better nutritional and sensory properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"The present meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) aimed to investigate the effect of oat intake on glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity. A literature search was carried out in PubMed, ScienceDirect Online and The Cochrane Library (up to October 2013) for RCT that assessed the effect of oat intake on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. A total of fifteen articles with 673 subjects met the inclusion criteria. A random-effects model was used when the overall pooled studies exhibited significant heterogeneity. Otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used. Compared with controls, oat intake significantly reduced the concentrations of fasting insulin by 26 29 (95% CI - 12.32, -0.27) pmol/l (P=0.04) and the values of glucose AUC (GAUC; 0-120 min) by -30.23 (95% CI -43.65, -16.81) min X mmol/l (P<0.0001). There was a slight decrease in fasting glucose concentrations, glycated Hb concentrations and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance values in subjects who consumed oats, but the difference was not significant. In conclusion, oat intake significantly lowers fasting insulin concentrations and GAUC values. To further investigate the effect of oat intake on fasting glucose concentrations, additional long-term and high-quality RCT with a parallel design are required.",474,-1,1,1,-1,1,3,2,0,0,191
"The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of two plants rich in saponins on in vitro ruminal fermentation traits of vetch-oat hay using gas syringes as incubators. Two plants, Camellia sinensis and Trigonella foenum-greacum, were added to 200 mg of vetch-oat hay at levels of 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mg and 0, 48, 54, 60 and 66 mg, respectively. Gas production was dose-dependent for both plants and decreased for all incubation times with the increasing doses. Methane concentration was decreased at all inclusion levels and for each incubation time. The highest methane reduction was observed at 48h of incubation for both plants. This decrease varied between 48.78-52.84% and 45.52-72.35% for Camellia sinensis and Trigonella foenum-greacum, respectively. Ammonia-N concentrations also decreased significantly (P < 0.002) when the plants rich in saponins were included with the vetch-oat hay. In addition, these plants significantly inhibited the protozoa growth in ruminal fluid (P < 0.001). At 24h incubation, protozoa counts were reduced by 81.86% and 83.29% for the high levels of Camellia sinensis and Trigonella foenum-greacum, respectively. Finally, in vitro truly dry matter digestibility was significantly affected by the inclusion of plants rich in saponins (P < 0.05). It is suggested that addition of these saponin-rich plants to feed could modify the rumen fermentation and inhibit the release of methane and ammonia, which may be beneficial for improving nutrient utilization and animal growth.",475,1,99,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,233
"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Few studies have examined consumer acceptability or comprehension of cholesterol-lowering claims on food labels. Our objective was to assess consumer attitudes and understanding of cholesterol-lowering claims regarding. plant sterols (PS) and Oat fibre (OF). SUBJECTS/METHODS: We conducted two studies on: (1) PS claims and (2) OF claims. Both studies involved a randomized mock-packaged experiment within an online survey administered to Canadian consumers. in the PS study (n=721), we tested three PS-related claims (disease risk reduction claim, function claim and nutrient content claim) and a 'tastes great' claim (control) on identical margarine containers. Similarly, in the OF study (n=710), we tested three claims related to OF and a 'taste great' claim on identical cereal boxes. In both studies, participants answered the same set of questions on attitudes and understanding of claims after seeing each mock package. RESULTS: All claims that mentioned either PS or OF resulted in more positive attitudes than the taste control claim (P < 0.0001), despite all products within each study having the same nutrition profile. How consumers responded to the nutrition claims between the two studies was influenced by contextual factors such as familiarity with the functional food/component and the food product that carried the claim. CONCLUSIONS: Permitted nutrition claims are approved based on physiological evidence and are allowed on any food product as long as it meets the associated nutrient criteria. However, it is difficult to generalize attitudes and understanding of claims when they are so highly dependent on contextual factors.",476,1,-1,0,99,0,1,1,2,1,246
"Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy, triggered by dietary gluten. The only treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Oats are included in the list of gluten-free ingredients by European Regulation, but the safety of oats in CD is still a matter of debate. The present study examined the capability of different oat cultivars of activating the gliadin-induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-dependent events in some in vitro models of CD. In addition, we compared this capability with the electrophoresis pattern of peptic-tryptic digests of the proteins of the oat cultivars. K562(S) cells agglutination, transepithelial electrical resistance of T84-cell monolayers, intracellular levels of TG2 and phosphorylated form of protein 42-44 in T84 cells were the early gliadin-dependent events studied. The results showed that the Nave oat cultivar elicited these events, whereas Irina and Potenza varieties did not. The ability of a cultivar to activate the above-described events was associated with the electrophoretic pattern of oat proteins and their reactivity to anti-gliadin antibodies. We found significant differences among oat cultivars in eliciting the TG2-mediated events of CD inflammation. Therefore, the safety of an oat cultivar in CD might be screened in vitro by means of biochemical and biological assays, before starting a clinical trial to definitely assess its safety.",477,99,1,0,1,1,3,0,1,1,205
"The rheological behavior of oat milk (Avena sativa L.) at different concentration (5, 10, 15, and 20 A degrees Brix) was studied in the temperature range of 10, 20, 30, and 40 A degrees C using a controlled stress rheometer. Power law model adequately described the flow behavior of oat milk (0.881-0.987). The value of flow behavior index (n) was less than unity (0.19-0.68) at all temperature and concentration range indicating the shear-thinning (pseudoplastic) nature of oat milk. Consistency index (k) increased with soluble solids concentrations and decreased with temperature. The Arrhenius equation adequately described the effect of temperature on the viscosity. The activation energies for flow of oat milk quantified using Arrhenius equation increased with solid concentration and ranged from 7.43 to 303.64 kJ/mol. The effect of concentration on the viscosity followed the exponential model. The empirical model obtained from the study could well-describe the combined effect of temperature and concentration within the range of the study.

"The impact of oat beta-glucan fortification (1.4%) on the acidification and gelation kinetics of fermented skimmed milk (12% total solids) as well as the effects of inclusion of a probiotic strain (Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei B117) into the yogurt starter culture (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus Y 6.15 and Streptococcus thermophilus Y 4.10) and fermentation temperature (36, 38 and 40 degrees C) have been explored by dynamic rheometry, pH measurements and microbial enumeration. The viability/growth of the mixed culture bacteria was also evaluated upon storage. Incorporation of beta-glucan to milk resulted in phase separation between proteins and the added polysaccharide, altering the entire gelation process as manifested by the development of a transient gel structure at the early stages, followed by significant (P < 0.05) retardation of both protein aggregation and acidification kinetics, and finally the formation of significantly weaker gels compared to control formulations. Furthermore, fortification of milk with beta-glucan led to a liquid-like structure (tan delta > 1) at the end of fermentation (pH = 4.6) when performed at 36 degrees C. A higher fermentation temperature accelerated the acidification kinetics, yielding a shorter gelation time, but the storage modulus values of milk gels decreased. Inclusion of the probiotic strain into the yogurt starter culture seemed to increase the gelation rate without affecting the gelation time and gel strength. Viability of all three culture bacteria was enhanced by decreasing fermentation temperature and during storage. Moreover, the L. paracasei showed good compatibility with the yogurt starter culture and the addition of beta-glucan enhanced the viability of the probiotic strain in the fermented products throughout cold storage (4 degrees C).

"The dependence of the curcumin loading capacity (CLC) of octenylsuccinate oat beta-glucan (OSG) micelles on the structural parameters (degree of substitution, DS; molecular weight, M-w) of OSG was unknown and explored in this study. Meanwhile, the curcumin-loaded OSG micelle (COM) was first characterized. The results from response surface methodology revealed that the linear effects of M-w and stirrer input power, as well as the quadratic effect of DS, were significant (p<0.05). The maximum CLC value of the OSG micelle was obtained as 4.21 mu g/mg. Dynamic light scattering showed that the average size and zeta potential of the COM were 308 nm and -10.8 mV, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy evidenced that the COM was elliptical in shape. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimeltry, and X-ray diffraction revealed that curcumin was loaded in OSG micelles in an amorphous form by interacting with OSG molecules.",480,0,0,1,99,99,1,0,2,2,148
"Functional properties of conventional oat materials are relatively poor with respect to foam and emulsion formation and stabilization. This is largely due to the poor solubility of oat proteins and the presence of lipids in aqueous extracts of oats. In the experimental part of this study, extracts were prepared from different type oat flours (oat endosperm flour, oat fine flour, CO2-defatted whole oat flour and CO2-defatted oat flour) with a buffered aqueous extraction procedure at acidic (pH 4.5 and 6.5) and basic (pH 8.5 and 10.5) regions. The solubility of proteins was the highest at pH 10.5 and NaCl concentration of 2%. Among the extracts, CO2-oat flour showed improved foaming and emulsifying properties at basic pH values. The presence of 0.1% NaCl resulted in the lowest foam volumes, but the emulsion activity and stability values being the highest. Sucrose addition resulted in increased foam and emulsion stability of suspensions. Heat treatment at 80 degrees C impaired foam properties, whereas the stability of emulsions increased with the increase in temperature from 20 degrees C to 80 degrees C.

"Gluten-free bread crumb generally firms more rapidly than regular wheat bread crumb. We here combined differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), texture analysis, and time-domain proton nuclear magnetic resonance (TD H-1 NMR) to investigate the mechanisms underlying firming of gluten-free rice and oat bread. The molecular mobility of water and biopolyrners in flour/water model systems and changes thereof after heating and subsequent cooling to room temperature were investigated as a basis for underpinning the interpretation of TD H-1 NMR profiles of fresh crumb. The proton distributions of wheat and rice flour/water model systems were comparable, while that of oat flour/water samples showed less resolved peaks and an additional population at higher T-2 relaxation times representing lipid protons. No significant crumb moisture loss during storage was observed for the gluten-free bread loaves. Crumb firming was mainly caused by amylopectin retrogradation and water redistribution within bread crumb. DSC, texture, and TD H-1 NMR data correlated well and showed that starch retrogradation and crumb firming are much more pronounced in rice flour bread than in oat flour bread.",482,1,1,0,99,99,2,0,1,2,173
"Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is associated with an increase in oxidative stress, such as DNA, lipid and protein oxidations. This study investigated, for the first time, the ability of digested food proteins to reduce Cr(VI) and scavenge free radicals. Protamex, an endopeptidase was used to digest oat bran protein isolates for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h. The hydrolysates (1 mg/ml) showed a maximum Cr(VI)-reducing activity of 5.4 +/- 0.4% and 44.6% at pH 7.4 and 3.0, respectively. The difference might be due to charge or conformation changes depending on the pH. The 2 h hydrolysate possessed the highest O-2(-.) inhibition activity (57.4 +/- 5.1%), while the 1 h hydrolysate had the highest HO inhibition (11.6 +/- 0.6%). A correlation (R-2 = 0.82) was observed between the O-2(-.) scavenging activities of hydrolysates and their Cr(VI)-reducing activities at pH 3.0 only. Further investigations of the digested oat bran proteins are required to determine their ability to reduce Cr(VI) oxidative stress damage in vivo. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"A novel method that uses bioprocessed oat flour (yeast-fermented leaven) for the preparation of composite wheat-oat (50:50%) bread was proposed. The objective of the study was to compare physical (loaf volume and specific weight, crumb texture, changes in texture during storage, crumb heterogeneity) and sensorial (aroma, flavor, texture, overall acceptability) properties of bread produced by this method with the properties of bread produced by the standard methods (straight-dough and two-phase). It was observed that, after fermentation, oat leaven compared with wheat leaven had a more concise consistency and that, during dough preparation, a greater addition of water was required. The bread produced in this way is characterized by a comparable volume to bread produced from wheat yeast-fermented leaven, while crumb firmness and elasticity are significantly greater. Methods using yeast-fermented leaven prepared from different types of flour should be tested for other composite wheat breads. Practical Applications In general, a straight dough-baking method sometimes with process modifications is applied for the preparation of composite wheat-oat bread, but there is still lack of information describing the potential of using oat yeast-fermented leaven. Besides the importance of health (latest studies show that longer fermentation process can be used to increase the antioxidant activity of bread), the preparation of oat yeast-fermented leaven significantly increases dough yield and enhances the success - ease of dough formation. In this method, to initiate the fermentation of the leaven, a small amount of yeast (1%) is required. Using oat yeast-fermented leaven produces satisfactory baking results and also economic benefits and it can be used for organic bread. In addition, there is no need to change the bakery equipment that enables the rapid introduction of this method into practice.",485,99,99,99,99,1,1,0,0,4,280
"Scope: Inflammatory status can increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events linked to platelet activity and involvement of microparticles (MP) released from platelets (PMP), leukocytes (LMP), and monocytes (MMP). These MP carry host cell-derived antigens that may act as markers of metabolic health. Subjects newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are offered appropriate standard dietary advice (SDA) but this may not be optimal as specific inclusion of other nutrients, such as oats, may add benefit. The effectiveness of such interventions can be tested by examination of MP activation markers. Methods and results: Subjects (n = 22) with type 2 diabetes participated in a randomized cross-over trial involving 8 wk interventions with either an oat-enriched diet (OAT) or following reinforced SDA. Responses were also compared with preintervention habitual (HAB) intake. OAT reduced the concentrations and proportions of fibrinogen-and tissue factor-related PMP and MMP_11b. The main effect of SDA was to reduce fibrinogen-activated PMP. Regardless of chronic intake, a healthy test meal led to postprandial declines in total PMP as well as tissue factor-, fibrinogen-, and P-selectin-positive PMP. Conclusion: OAT improved risk factors assessed by MP status, even in subjects with type 2 diabetes already well-controlled by diet and life-style alone.",486,-1,1,1,1,-1,3,2,0,0,199
"Some physical properties of the naked oat seeds were determined as a function of moisture content ranging from 9.56 to 18.07% (wet basis, w. b.). Seed length, width, thickness, and geometric mean diameter were increased from 7.89 to 8.81 mm, 2.32 to 3.09 mm, 1.85 to 2.77 mm, and 3.24 to 4.22 mm, respectively, with the increase of moisture content. The bulk and true densities of the seed samples were decreased from 682.1 to 533.1 kg/m(3) and from 1,280.6 to 1,162.8 kg/m(3), respectively. The average static friction coefficients of the seeds on the surfaces of plywood, stainless steel, and polypropylene knitted bags were increased from 0.403 to 0.674, from 0.371 to 0.496, and from 0.562 to 0.765, respectively, when the moisture content of these samples were increased from 9.56 to 18.07% (w. b.).

"Physicochemical properties of different beta-glucan purified from oat, barley and wheat, were investigated by measuring the composition, molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity ([eta]), and rheological properties. The main objective was to investigate the relationship between effects of regulation of cholesterol metabolism and antioxidant property on db/db diabetic mice of beta-glucans and their molecular weights and viscosities. Metformin was used as the positive control. The levels of blood glucose, serum lipid, liver lipid, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver were determined. Results showed that average values of molecular weight (MW) of beta-glucan from oat, wheat and barley were 172 kDa, 635 kDa and 743 kDa; the viscosities of beta-glucans were positively correlated with their corresponded molecular weights, and wheat and barley beta-glucan showed significant shear thinning ability compared to oat beta-glucan; Barley beta-glucans had higher G' compared to wheat and oat, and the latter had higher G ''. Blood glucose differences were not significant due to high variability, however serum TC, TG, liver TC, TG and LDL-C were lower in beta-glucan fed groups compared to control. Moreover, the HDL-C was higher in beta-glucan fed groups compared to control group. The addition of beta-glucan fed to the db/db diabetic mice significantly (P < 0.05) increased their liver SOD activities and reduced their MDA levels (P > 0.05). A correlation between the measured biological parameters and the molecular weight or viscosity of beta-glucan was observed. Lack of beta-glucanase degeneration was the main cause of the low MW beta-glucan and its diminished physiological effect. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Background: Foods that enhance satiety can help consumers to resist environmental cues to eat, and improve the nutritional quality of their diets. Viscosity generated by oat beta-glucan, influences gastrointestinal mechanisms that mediate satiety. Differences in the source, processing treatments, and interactions with other constituents in the food matrix affect the amount, solubility, molecular weight, and structure of the beta-glucan in products, which in turn influences the viscosity. This study examined the effect of two types of oatmeal and an oat-based ready-to-eat breakfast cereal (RTEC) on appetite, and assessed differences in meal viscosity and beta-glucan characteristics among the cereals. Methods: Forty-eight individuals were enrolled in a randomized crossover trial. Subjects consumed isocaloric breakfast meals containing instant oatmeal (IO), old-fashioned oatmeal (SO) or RTEC in random order at least a week apart. Each breakfast meal contained 218 kcal (150 kcal cereal, and 68 kcal milk) Visual analogue scales measuring appetite were completed before breakfast, and over four hours, following the meal. Starch digestion kinetics, meal viscosities, and beta-glucan characteristics for each meal were determined. Appetite responses were analyzed by area under the curve. Mixed models were used to analyze response changes over time. Results: IO increased fullness (p = 0.04), suppressed desire to eat (p = 0.01) and reduced prospective intake (p < 0.01) more than the RTEC over four hours, and consistently at the 60 minute time-point. SO reduced prospective intake (p = 0.04) more than the RTEC. Hunger scores were not significantly different except that IO reduced hunger more than the RTEC at the 60 minute time-point. IO and SO had higher beta-glucan content, molecular weight, gastric viscosity, and larger hydration spheres than the RTEC, and IO had greater viscosity after oral and initial gastric digestion (initial viscosity) than the RTEC. Conclusion: IO and SO improved appetite control over four hours comp",489,1,1,99,-1,1,3,1,0,1,302
"In this study, oat flour (OF) was used to replace wheat flour in tarhana formulation at the levels of 10, 20, 30 and 40% (w/w). Control sample did not contain OF. The results showed that addition of OF caused increases in levels of phenolic acids within tarhana samples. The most abundant phenolic acids were vanillic and ferulic acids, and they were followed by gallic acid. Tarhana samples with OF also showed higher antioxidant activities than control sample did. Compared with the control sample, the total phenolic content level increased with the increase in the amount of OF. The results of sensory analysis showed that OF addition neither caused any undesirable taste nor an odor and panelists emphasised a sweet taste as the OF amounts were increased. Therefore, tarhana supplemented with OF can be claimed to be a good source of minerals, phenolics and antioxidants as compared to tarhana without OF. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"The only known treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet (GFD), which initially meant abstention from wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Recently, oats free from contamination with wheat have been accepted in the GFD. Yet, reports indicate that all celiac disease patients may not tolerate oats. We hypothesized that celiac children comply well with a GFD and that most have included oats in their diet. A food questionnaire was used to check our patients; 316 questionnaires were returned. Mean time on the GFD was 6.9 years, and 96.8% of the children reported that they were trying to keep a strict GFD. However, accidental transgressions occurred in 263 children (83.2%). In 2 of 3 cases, mistakes took place when the patients were not at home. Symptoms after incidental gluten intake were experienced by 162(61.6%) patients, mostly (87.5%) from the gastrointestinal tract. Small amounts of gluten (<4 g) caused symptoms in 38% of the cases, and 68% reported symptoms during the first 3 hours after gluten consumption. Oats were included in the diet of 89.4% of the children for a mean of 3.4 years. Most (81.9%) ate purified oats, and 45.3% consumed oats less than once a week. Among those who did not consume oats, only 5.9% refrained because of symptoms. General compliance with the GFD was good. Only the duration of the GFD appeared to influence adherence to the diet. Most patients did not report adverse effects after long-term consumption of oats. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",491,-1,0,0,1,-1,1,2,2,0,249
"The objective was to study folate production of yeast strains, bacteria isolated from oat bran, and selected lactic acid bacteria as well as one propionibacterium in oat and barley based models. Simultaneously, we aimed at sustaining the stability of viscosity, representing the physicochemical state of beta-glucan. Total folate contents were determined microbiologically and vitamers for selected samples by UHPLC. Folate in yeast cells comprised mainly 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate. Folate production by microbes in YPD medium was different to that in cereal fermentations where vitamers included 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and formylated derivatives. Microbes producing significant amounts of folate without affecting viscosity were Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALKO743 and Candida milleri ABM4949 among yeasts and Pseudomonas sp. ON8 and Janthinobacterium sp. RB4 among bacteria. Net folate production was up to 120 ng/g after 24 h fermentation and could increase during 2-week storage. Glucose addition increased the proportion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Streptococcus thermophilus ABM5097, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Propionibacterium sp. ABM5378 produced folate but in lower concentrations. Both endogenous and added microbes contribute to folate enhancement. Selection of microbes with folate producing capability and limited hydrolytic activity will enable the development of products rich in folate and beta-glucan. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"The enzyme p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) is ubiquitous in plants and functions in the tyrosine catabolic pathway, resulting in the formation of homogentisate. Homogentisate is the aromatic precursor of all plastoquinones and tocochromanols, including tocopherols and tocotrienols. Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) has been genetically modified to express the gene avhppd-03 that encodes the protein AvHPPD-03 derived from oat (Avena sativa L.). The AvHPPD-03 isozyme has an inherent reduced binding affinity for mesotrione, a herbicide that inhibits the wild-type soybean HPPD enzyme. Expression of avhppd-03 in soybean plants confers a mesotrione-tolerant phenotype. Seeds from three different avhppd-03-expressing soybean events were quantitatively assessed for content of eight vitamin E isoforms. Although increased levels of two tocopherol isoforms were identified for each of the three soybean events, they were within, or not substantially different from, the ranges of these isoforms found in nontransgenic soybean varieties. The increases of these tocopherols in the avhppd-03-expressing soybean events may have a slight benefit with regard to vitamin E nutrition but, given the commercial processing of soybeans, are unlikely to have a material impact on human nutrition with regard to vitamin E concentrations in soybean oil.",494,0,0,1,1,1,3,0,2,0,189
"The impact of oat beta-glucan concentration and molecular weight (MW) on gel properties was investigated. Mixed MW gels/viscous solutions at 3, 4, and 5% beta-glucan with high molecular weight (HMVV):low molecular weight (LMW) ratios of 0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25, and 100:0 were evaluated. The 100:0 and 50:50 gels had the lowest tan delta values. The 50:50 gels had the highest storage moduli (G'), whereas 100:0 solutions did not gel. Peak melting temperature (T-p) was highest for 0:100 gels and decreased with the addition of HMW beta-glucan. Hardness, at 40% compression, increased with concentration, and 25:75 and 50:50 gels were hardest at each concentration. Ordered microstructure, apparent in 0:100 gels, diminished with HMW beta-glucan addition. Glucose addition resulted in lower tan delta values and firmer, harder gels compared to gels without glucose. Thus, the textural properties and melting profiles of beta-glucan gels can be manipulated by adjusting the ratios of molecular weight fractions or addition of sugar for different applications.",495,99,0,99,99,1,1,0,1,3,159
"Effects of fibre and beta-glucan on satiety have been reported in many studies, but no consensus has been reached. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of breakfasts varying in the dose of oat bran (4 g or 8 g beta-glucan). The approach was to study whether the food matrix (solid or liquid) into which the oat bran is incorporated influences postprandial satiety in otherwise similar meal settings. Thirty healthy females were offered four different breakfasts: biscuits + juice (0 g beta-glucan), enriched biscuits + juice (4 g beta-glucan), biscuits + enriched juice (4 g beta-glucan) and enriched biscuits + enriched juice (8 g beta-glucan) in a random order on separate test days. The sensations associated with hunger and satiety were evaluated using visual analogue scales (VAS) before and after ingesting the test breakfasts and every 30 min until 210 min. Oat bran addition in breakfasts increased postprandial satiety especially when both juice and biscuits were enriched (8 g of beta-glucan). Addition of oat bran to juice enhanced satiety and related feelings more effectively than the addition into biscuits. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",496,1,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,189
"Oats (Avena saliva L.) have received significant attention for their positive and consistent health benefits when consumed as a whole grain food, attributed in part to mixed-linkage (1-3,1-4)-beta-D-glucan (referred to as beta-glucan). Unfortunately, the standard enzymatic method of measurement for oat beta-glucan is costly and does not provide the high-throughput capability needed for plant breeding in which thousands of samples are measured over a short period of time. The objective of this research was to test a microenzymatic approach for high-throughput phenotyping of oat beta-glucan. Fifty North American elite lines were chosen to span the range of possible values encountered in elite oats. Pearson and Spearman correlations (r) ranged from 0.81 to 0.86 between the two methods. Although the microenzymatic method did contain bias compared with the results for the standard streamlined method, this bias did not substantially decrease its ability to determine beta-glucan content. In addition to a substantial decrease in cost, the microenzymatic approach took as little as 6% of the time compared with the streamlined method. Therefore, the microenzymatic method for beta-glucan evaluation is an alternative method that can enhance high-throughput phenotyping in oat breeding programs.",497,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,189
"The effect of storage was studied on grain metabolites, functional properties and digestibility of three oat cultivars selected in Serbia - Dunav, Vrbas and NS Tara. During the 12 and 24 months of storage, there was a decrease on average in total proteins (10.98% and 15.95%) lipids (7.55% and 11.82%), crude cellulose (6.65% and 14.77%) and starch concentration (6.48% and 9.48%), and an increase in total ash concentration (4.8% and 9%) and dry matter (4.53% and 5.92%). Storage period caused a decrease in beta-glucan concentration. The concentration of total phenolics (28.79-41.19%) and caffeic acid markedly decreased after 24 months of storage. The storage period significantly influenced the ferric reducing ability (FRAP) (36.34-43.12%) and the DPPH radical scavenging activity (76.92-237.14%). Organic matter digestibility of oat grains was slightly changed, but remained over 70%. Based on the present study, oat grain should not be stored longer than 12 months since phenolics contribute markedly to health promoting effect of oats. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Brewing with commercial flours has the potential to reduce mashing times and improve brewhouse efficiency. At present, however, no studies are available assessing the application of commercial oat and sorghum flours as brewing adjuncts. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the quality and processability of mashes/worts produced with 10-90 % oat or sorghum flour as well as to reveal the advantages and limitations of their use as a substitute for barley malt. For these purposes, both flour types were fully analyzed in terms of brewing-relevant characteristics using standard methods, Lab-on-a-Chip capillary electrophoresis, and scanning electron microscopy. Laboratory-scale mashing trials were performed to assess the effect of up to 90 % flour adjunct on mash/wort quality. Equivalent factors were introduced to determine the performance efficiency of different oat/sorghum flour concentrations. Commercial oat flour sourced in Ireland exhibited significantly more protein, beta-glucan, and fat, less starch, ash, and polyphenols, as well as a lower starch gelatinization temperature than commercial sorghum flour obtained from the USA. Worts produced with 10-90 % oat or sorghum flour had lighter colors, higher pH values, and lower concentrations of foam-positive proteins as well as free amino nitrogen compared to 100 % barley malt worts. In terms of extract yields, the use of up to 70 % oat flour and 50 % sorghum flour, respectively, has proven economically beneficial. Worts containing up to 70 % oat flour showed a very good or good fermentability, those containing 30-50 % sorghum flour resulted, however, in a lower alcohol production.",499,1,1,99,1,99,3,0,0,2,252

The spectra of 14 commercial products were registered in the spectral range of 4,000-370 cm(-1). Chemometric approach was applied to collect spectral and reference data on fat content, fatty acid composition, and the heat of combustion, and to correlate them. Reference data were obtained with the use of Soxhlet method, gas chromatography, and bomb calorimetry. Statistically significant coefficients in the determination of spectral data and fat, linoleic acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid content, and energy value are R (2) = 0.93, R (2) = 0.93, R (2) = 0.82, R (2) = 0.92, and R (2) = 0.95, respectively.

"Our objective was to assess the pasture productivity and forage characteristics of 2 fall-grown oat (Avena sativa L.) cultivars, specifically for extending the grazing season and reducing reliance on harvested forages by replacement dairy heifers. A total of 160 gravid Holstein heifers (80 heifers/yr) were stratified by weight, and assigned to 1 of 10 identical research pens (8 heifers/pen). Initial body weights were 480 43.5 kg in 2011 and 509 +/- 39.4 kg in 2012. During both years of the trial, four 1.0-ha pasture replicates were seeded in August with Ogle oat (Schumitsch Seed Inc., Antigo, WI), and 4 separate, but similarly configured, pasture replicates were seeded with Forage Plus oat (Kratz Farms, Slinger, WI). Heifer groups were maintained as units, assigned to specific pastures, and then allowed to graze fall-oat pastures for 6 h daily before returning to the barn, where they were offered a forage-based basal total mixed ration. Two heifer groups were retained in confinement (without grazing) as controls and offered the identical total mixed ration as pasture groups. During 2011, available forage mass increased with strong linear and quadratic effects for both cultivars, peaking at almost 9 Mg/ha on October 31. In contrast, forage mass was not affected by evaluation date in 2012, remaining <= 2,639 kg/ha across all dates because of droughty climatic conditions. During 2012, Ogle exhibited greater forage mass than Forage Plus across all sampling dates (2,678 vs. 1,856 kg/ha), largely because of its more rapid maturation rate and greater canopy height. Estimates of energy density for oat forage ranged from 59.6 to 69.1% during 2011, and ranged narrowly from 68.4 to 70.4% during 2012. For 2011, responses for both cultivars had strong quadratic character, in which the most energy-dense forages occurred in mid November, largely due to accumulation of water-soluble carbohydrates that reached maximum concentrations of 18.2 and 15.1% for Forage Plus and Ogle, respectively.

The most abundant phenolic acids were ferulic and vanillic acids, followed by syringic acid in the samples with SCO. Tarhana samples with SCO also showed higher antioxidant activities than the control. Compared with the control, the total phenolic content increased when the level of SCO addition was increased. SCO addition did not have a deteriorative effect on sensory properties of tarhana samples and resulted in acceptable soup properties in terms of overall acceptability.

"Barley malt is the preferred brewing material these days because of its high extract content and high enzyme activities. However, when substituting malted barley with oats to create a unique beer flavor and aroma, endogenous malt enzymes become the limiting factor. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of 10-40 % unmalted oats on the quality of high-gravity mashes/worts and to investigate the limitations of endogenous malt enzymes as well as the benefits of the application of industrial enzymes. The enzyme mix Ondea(A (R)) Pro was found to be particularly suitable for mashing with unmalted oats and was therefore used in the present rheological tests and laboratory-scale mashing trials. In order to gain detailed information about the biochemical processes occurring during mashing, the quality of mashes was comprehensively analyzed after each mash rest using standard methods described by Mitteleuropaische Brautechnische Analysenkommission and Lab-on-a-Chip capillary electrophoresis. Mashing with up to 40 % oats resulted in increased mash consistencies, color/pH (20 A degrees C) values, beta-glucan concentrations, wort viscosities 12.0 %, and filtration times as well as decreased FAN and extract contents. The application of Ondea(A (R)) Pro enormously increased the color of worts despite lower pH values but considerably improved the quality and processability of 30 or 40 % oat-containing mashes/worts.

"Background: The composition and surface structure of dietary lipids influence their intestinal degradation. Intake of liposomes made of fractionated oat oil (LOO) is suggested to affect the digestion process and postprandial lipemia and also induce satiety. Objective: In the present study, the metabolic effects on plasma lipids and gut hormones related to satiety were investigated in healthy individuals after intake of LOO, with dairy lipids as placebo. Design: Two blinded randomized studies with crossover design were performed. In the first study, 19 subjects consumed 35 g lipids from LOO or yoghurt in a breakfast meal. In a follow-up study, 15 women consumed 14 or 1.8 g lipids from LOO mixed in yoghurt. Blood samples were analyzed for plasma lipids, insulin, glucose, and intestinal hormones CCK, PYY, GLP-1, and GLP-2 before and four times after the meal. Subjective analysis of satiety was measured using a visual analog scale questionnaire. Participants recorded their food intake during the rest of the day. Results: Intake of 35 and 14 g lipids from LOO significantly increased plasma concentrations of CCK, GLP-1, GLP-2, and PYY postprandially. This coincided with a prolonged elevation of triglycerides and large cholesterol-containing particles. Non-esterified fatty acids decreased after intake of 14 and 1.8 g lipids from LOO. The subjective sensation of satiety in women was increased 7 h after intake of 35 g lipids from LOO without any difference in food intake. Our results indicate that intake of 14 g lipids from LOO at breakfast substantially reduced energy intake during the rest of the day. Conclusions: This study suggests that intake of LOO prolong lipid digestion, affect postprandial plasma lipids and have an effect on satiety. The effect of LOO on GLP-2 indicates that intake of LOO also improve gut health.",510,1,1,1,99,-1,3,1,0,1,290
"Consumption of nutritionally enhanced wheat-oat bread naturally rich in beta-glucans originating from extra-wholemeal oat flour with improved digestibility by lactic fermentation provides unambiguous health benefits associated with a slower blood glucose release and a higher subjective satiety determined by a postprandial study. However, an undesirable elevated acrylamide formation in the crust of bread was observed due to a high level of a main precursor amino acid L-asparagine in oat flour. Lactic fermentation of oat flour by Lactobacillus plantarum and 30% substitution of extra-wholemeal oat flour with fermented oat sourdough led to more attractive organoleptic quality of wheat-oat fermented bread and to a decrease of pH value which suppressed acrylamide level up to 10%. As a more effective tool of acrylamide reduction a commercial asparaginase enzyme was used, applied on a surface of the bread loaf during proofing and before baking. This enzyme treatment resulted in a more than 46% decrease of acrylamide in the crust from 390 mu g/kg to the level of 210 mu g/kg without any alterations to the expected quality of the newly designed bread.",511,99,-1,1,99,1,2,1,0,2,178

The results revealed that the acidic polypeptides (12S-A) of oat globulin exerted great influence over the gelling ability of oat protein. Partial hydrolysis by flavourzyme and trypsin could significantly improve oat protein gel strength, especially at pHs 8-9 by modulating the balance between the electrostatically repulsive force and the hydrophobic attractive force among polypeptide chains during the gelling process. The gels prepared with flavourzyme and trypsin treated oat proteins have comparable or higher mechanical strength than soy protein gels at neutral pH. At pH 9 the gel made of trypsin treated oat protein even showed comparable mechanical strength to egg white protein gels under the same pH. Both oat protein and its hydrolysate gel exhibited excellent water-holding capacity at neutral or mildly alkaline conditions. The results of this study indicate that oat protein has a promising potential to be used as new and cost-effective gelling ingredient of plant origin to provide texture and structure in food products.

"The viscosity of the soluble fibre, beta-glucan, has been shown to influence its ability to lower serum cholesterol and postprandial blood glucose levels. The impact of various amylases, proteases and lipase on the solubility and resulting viscosity of beta-glucan extracted from oat bran cereals with a range of beta-glucan concentrations and molecular weights was investigated. Addition of enzymes increased the final viscosity of high molecular weight beta-glucan in cereals by facilitating the release of beta-glucan from the food matrix. For cereals with partially depolymerized beta-glucan, the addition of digestive enzymes decreased the final viscosity by eliminating the contribution of starch and protein to viscosity. Final viscosity varied depending on enzyme combinations including pancreatin, salivary and microbial alpha-amylases, microbial protease, porcine protease, trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin. Addition of lipase did not significantly affect viscosity or solubility of beta-glucan extracted from oat crackers. Addition of lichenase showed that beta-glucan was the major contributor of viscosity to the system, with negligible interference from other components. The viscosity of the optimized protocol was compared to physiological results previously obtained. The viscosity of beta-glucan extracted with pancreatin plus microbial alpha-amylase (pH 6.9) was predictive of LDL-cholesterol reduction (R-2 = 0.847) and glycemic response (R-2 = 0.883).

"Oat products containing beta-glucan are documented for lowering blood cholesterol that could be beneficial for preventing coronary heart disease. Oat products (oat flour, oat bran concentrate, and Nutrim) were dry-blended with ground chia (Salvia hispanica L) that contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for improving nutritional and functional qualities. The pasting and rheological properties of oat chia composites with 10, 20, and 50 g chia/100 g were characterized using Rapid Visco Analyzer followed by an advanced rheometer. Shear thinning properties were observed for all the composites. The pasting and rheological properties of oat products were not greatly influenced by 10 g or 20 g chia/100 g replacements but were improved at the 50 g/100 g replacement level. Also, these composites had improved water holding capacities compared with their starting oat products from 5 g to 250 g water/100 g, respectively. Also, whole chia seeds currently used in food products on the market are not easily utilized by the human body because of an extremely hard coat. These fine particle composites of oat products with ground chia were prepared by a feasible procedure for producing composites having improved nutritional value, texture quality, and functional food applications.

"The aim of the present study is to investigate the hypocholesterolemic effect of dietary oat oil in rats, fed with a hypercholesterolemic diet. The rats were divided into three groups and fed with the experiment diets for 30 days, containing soybean oil, oat oil, or rice bran oil at a dose of 70 g/kg. It was found that the oat oil lowered plasma total and LDL-cholesterol, and also reduced liver total, free cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and triglycerides concentrations significantly, as well as rice bran oil. Moreover, the faecal weight, total lipids, and bile acids concentrations, in the oat oil and rice bran oil groups, were significantly increased compared with that in the soybean oil group. We can conclude that dietary oat oil improves hypercholesterolemia in rats fed a hypercholesterolemic diet, by promoting excretions of faecal lipids and bile acids. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Bread is consumed all over the world. However, so far, production of large volume bread is only possible with wheat. Alternatives, such as oats, are less suitable but this is partly due to the lack of knowledge about their functionality for other purposes than porridge, which is their most common use. Existing standard tests for the dough making characteristics of wheat flour are not suitable for oat flour, hampering research to optimize oats for bread-making purposes. We therefore set out to develop a test to evaluate oat in relation to mixing and dough making properties using wheat as a model. It was possible to reproduce the profile of various qualities of wheat flour using mixtures of oat flour and gluten in different proportions. Our standard test was based on a dough system composed of 87.2% oat flour and 12.8% gluten and it presented similar properties to a wheat flour with regard to resistance to extension. This dough system was sensitive and reliable (coefficient of variation lower than 10%) for detecting differences among oat cultivars, and it can be used to screen oat varieties and individual oat components in relation to relevant properties for bread-making purposes.

"Using oats as a raw material in brewing has recently become the focus of increased interest. This is due to research findings that have shown that oats can be consumed safely by coeliac sufferers. It is also a response to consumer demand for products with novel sensory properties. In this study, beer was produced entirely from oat malt, from barley malt and from oat and barley malts mixed with various quantities of unmalted oats. Compared with barley wort, wort made from malted oats provided a lower extract content and had a higher protein content, but a lower free amino nitrogen content (FAN). The oat wort also showed increased viscosity and haze. The addition of unmalted oats during wort production produced significant changes in the physico-chemical parameters of both oat and barley worts and beers. Unmalted oats caused an increase in wort viscosity and haze, and a reduction in total soluble nitrogen and FAN. Unmalted oats also contributed to lowering the concentration of higher alcohols and esters. Beer made from 100% oat and barley malts exhibited a similar alcohol content. The use of an oat adjunct in both cases resulted in a lower ethanol content. The introduction of enzyme preparations during the production of wort with oat adjunct had many benefits: increased extract content and FAN; a higher volume of wort; and a lower viscosity that led to faster wort filtration. This research suggests that the use of enzymes is necessary to make production using a high proportion of oats in the grist profitable.

"The objective of this study was to compare the effect of the fungicides prochloraz and tebuconazole (0-1 mu g/ml) on lag phase, growth rate, and T-2 + HT-2 toxin production by strains of Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium langsethiae on oat-based media under different conditions of water activity (a(w); 0.98 and 0.95) x temperature (15 and 25 degrees C). Relative effective dose values for the fungicides required to inhibit growth by 50% (ED50) and 90% (ED90) and T-2 + HT-2 production were determined. The lag phases prior to growth were prolonged at the marginal aw x temperature conditions tested and by the presence of the fungicides. The growth rates of E sporotrichioides and E langsethiae were similarly inhibited by prochloraz compared with the controls. However, in the presence of tebuconazole, E langsethiae was much more tolerant with very little inhibitory effects of the fungicide. The ED50 values ranged from 0.08 to >1.0 mu g/ml for prochloraz and from 0.34 to >1.0 mu g/ml for tebuconazole in the case of F. sporotrichioides. For F. langsethiae, these values were 0.09 to >1.0 and 0.31 to >1.0 mu g/ml at the two temperatures and aw levels tested. Prochloraz (0.2-0.4 mu g/ml) effectively inhibited toxin production at 15 degrees C and the two aw levels examined. However, at 25 degrees C the fungicide was less effective, regardless of the aw level. For tebuconazole, there were significant differences in efficacy against the E sporotrichioides and E langsethiae strains. The latter species produced consistently higher amounts of T-2 + HT-2 toxin at both 15 and 25 degrees C and 0.98 a(w).

"Rye bran, oat bran and barley fibre have been compared as additives in low-fat sausages and meatballs. The water/protein ratio and starch content were constant to allow direct comparisons. Oat bran was the best alternative in low-fat sausages due to its gelling ability upon heating. These sausages exhibited low process (0.9%) and frying losses (10.9%), and high values of firmness (11.0 N) and sensory acceptance. The sausages containing barley fibre, with the highest amount of soluble beta-glucan, had high losses (3.8% and 19.6%) and the lowest firmness (4.6 N). Rye bran was suitable in meatballs, probably due to its particulate nature, which is more acceptable in this type of meat product, where the gelling properties are not as important as in sausages. There was no significant difference between the firmness of meatballs containing rye bran (6.1 N) and the reference (7.5 N), after pan-frying. Meatballs with oat bran or barley fibre were less firm (3.6 N and 2.0 N). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",520,1,-1,0,1,99,2,1,1,1,166
"Arnphiphilic oat beta-glucan derivatives carrying octenylsuccinic groups as hydrophobic moieties have been synthesized. Materials with a different degree of substitution (DS) and weight-average molecular weight (M-w) for oat beta-glucan were prepared and characterized using elemental analysis, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that octenylsuccinate oat beta-glucan (OSG) can self-assemble into spherical micelles in water with an average size ranging from 175 to 600 nm. OSG micelles were negatively charged as indicated by zeta-potential measurement. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of OSGs varied from 0.206 to 0.039 mg/mL, depending on the DS and M-w of the oat beta-glucan. It was found that the presence of OSG micelles in aqueous solution could significantly enhance the solubility of curcumin by 880 fold. Thus, OSG might have great potential in applications as hydrophobic nutrient delivery carriers.",521,0,1,1,1,99,3,0,1,1,148

A ultra high performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/TOFMS) method was developed and validated to screen for the presence of these mycotoxins in those cereal matrices. Matrix-matched calibration curves were used to compensate for ion suppression and extraction losses and the recovery values were in agreement with the minimum requirements of Regulation 401/2006/EC (70-110%). For most mycotoxins, the LODs obtained allowed detection in compliance with the maximum permitted levels set in Regulation EC/2006/1881, with the exception of OTA in all cereals and AFB1 in yellow noodles. Extra target analysis of OTA in oat flakes and wheat noodles was performed by HPLC with fluorescence detection. High rates of contamination were observed in paddy rice (23% DON, 23% FB1, 7% AFB(1), 2% AFG(1) and 2% AFG(2)), white wheat noodles (33% DON and 5% OTA) and oat flakes (17% DON, 2% OTA and 2% AFB(1)), whereas the rates of contamination were lower in polished rice (2% AFG(1) and 4% HT-2 toxin) and yellow noodles (5% DON). Low rates of co-occurrence of several mycotoxins were observed only for white wheat noodles (5%) and paddy rice (7%). White noodles were contaminated with DON and/or OTA, while combinations of AFG(1), AFB(1), DON and FB1 were found in paddy rice. Yellow noodles were contaminated with DON only; oat flakes contained DON, OTA or AFB(1), and polished rice was contaminated with AFG(1) and HT-2 toxin.",522,-1,99,-1,1,99,1,2,0,2,272
"Avenacosides A (AA) and B (AB) as well as 26-desglucoavenacoside A (26dAA) were quantified in oats using rapid and sensitive method utilising UPLC-TQ-MS. In the grain, AA and AB were revealed as the primary saponins, whereas in the husks; dAA was predominant. Inconsistent with the published data, observed concentrations of AA and AB in the grain were very similar. Presumably, this is due to higher sensitivity and better selectivity of the mass spectrometry-based quantification method, thus allowing for more precise measurements. Elevated level of an active fungicidal form of saponin, dAA in the husks possibly indicates they are more prone to fungal attacks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"The health-beneficial properties of oats have led to an increase in the consumption of oats and oat-based food products in recent years. Fusarium langsethiae grows on small grain cereals, especially oats and can result in contamination with type A trichothecenes (T-2 toxin (T-2) and HT-2 toxin (HT-2)) in crops pre- and post-harvest. The aim of this work was to assess the efficacy of three fungicides (fenpropimorph, prochloraz and tebuconazole) on temporal growth of two F. langsethiae strains and the accumulation of T-2 and HT-2 in oat grains, under different water activities (a(w); 0.95 and 0.98) and temperatures (15 and 25 degrees C). All the antifungal agents reduced growth rates when compared to controls, and this increased with increasing fungicide dose. The ranges of ED50 values (mg/kg) were 65-270 for fenpropimorph, 0.25 -4.2 for prochloraz, and 0.3-14 for tebuconazole. The ED90 values (mg/kg) ranged from 170 to > 800, 0.5 to > 10 and 0.5 to > 15 for these three fungicides respectively. The ED50 values were not statistically significantly affected by the factors a(w), temperature or strain. However, there were significant differences among the fungicides. Fenpropimorph proved less efficient that the two azoles, which do not differ significantly. In general, levels of HT-2 were higher than T-2 in all cultures regardless of environmental conditions. Overall, HT-2 concentration was always higher at 25 than 15 degrees C and increased from day 14 to day 21. Levels of both toxins generally decreased with increasing fungicide dose regardless of fungicide type, strain and incubation time. No toxins were detected in cultures at 0.95 a(w) in the presence of any of the three fungicides. Also under wetter conditions at 0.98 a(w) neither mycotoxin was found in cultures treated with prochloraz at doses >1 mg/kg (15 degrees C) or >3 mg/kg (25 degrees C) or tebuconazole at doses >6 mg/kg (15 or 25 degrees C).

"The objective of this study was to (1) optimize the utilization of wheat-based dried distillers grains with soluble (wDDGS) by blending with oat (Avena sativa L.) grain as an alternative feed for beef cattle when the barley price is high and (2) investigate the effect of blending on biochemical, biodegradation, and nutritional profiles. Oat grains were blended with wDDGS produced in western Canada at different levels (4:0, 3:1, 2:2, and 1:3 on %DM basis in two batches, denoted O0, O25, O50, and O75, respectively). The study revealed that increasing the wDDGS resulted in increasing most nutrient contents linearly (P < 0.05) except for starch and cell wall materials, which were linearly decreased (from 43.6 to 12.0% and from 34.5 to 29.1% of DM for starch and NDF, respectively). When wDDGS was increased in the blend/mixture, intestinally absorbable protein and degradable balance of protein increased (P < 0.05).

"Many celiac disease patients tolerate oats, but limited data are available on its long-term consumption. This was evaluated in the present study, focusing on small-bowel mucosal histology and gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac adults maintaining a strict gluten-free diet with or without oats. Altogether 106 long-term treated celiac adults were enrolled for this cross-sectional follow-up study. Daily consumption of oats and fiber was assessed, and small-bowel mucosal morphology and densities of CD3+, + and sigma+ intraepithelial lymphocytes determined. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by a validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. Seventy (66%) out of the 106 treated celiac disease patients had consumed a median of 20 g of oats (range 1-100 g) per day for up to eight years; all consumed oat products bought from general stores. Daily intake and long-term consumption of oats did not result in small-bowel mucosal villous damage, inflammation, or gastrointestinal symptoms.

Several clinical trials have demonstrated that most celiac patients can tolerate a medium-high quantity of oats without any negative clinical effects; however, the inclusion of oats in GFD is still a matter of debate. In this study, Italian children with CD were enrolled in a 15-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Participants were randomized in two groups following either A-B treatment (6 months of diet A, 3 months of standard GFD, 6 months of diet B), or B-A treatment (6 months of diet B, 3 months of standard GFD, 6 months of diet A). A and B diets included gluten-free (GF) products (flour, pasta, biscuits, cakes and crisp toasts) with either purified oats or placebo. Clinical data (Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rate Scale [GSRS] score) and intestinal permeability tests (IPT), were measured through the study period. Although the study is still blinded, no significant differences were found in GSRS score or the urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio between the two groups after 6 months of treatment.

"Nutritional composition of oat kernels from 18 genotypes grown in six environments in North Dakota, U.S.A., was analyzed by chemical means. Of the macronutrients, mean starch concentration was 56.5%, protein was 18.1%, oil was 7.9%, neutral detergent fiber (insoluble fiber) was 6.0%, beta-glucan (soluble fiber) was 5.2%, ash was 1.9%, and soluble carbohydrate was 0.6%. These add up to 96.2%, which appears to account for most of the mass of the oat kernel. Protein amino acid analysis indicated 4.5% lysine and 1.8% methionine.

"Sixty samples of 'ForagePlus' oat were selected from a previous plot study for analysis of in vitro gas production (IVGP) on the basis of 2 factors: (1) high (n = 29) or low (n = 31) neutral detergent fiber (NDF; 62.7 +/- 2.61 and 45.1 +/- 3.91%, respectively); and (2) the range of water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) within the high- and low-NDF groups. For the WSC selection factor, concentrations ranged from 4.7 to 13.4% (mean = 7.9 +/- 2.06%) and from 3.5 to 19.4% (mean = 9.7 +/- 4.57%) within high- and low-NDF forages, respectively. Our objectives were to assess the relationships between IVGP and various agronomic or nutritional characteristics for high- and low-NDF fall-oat forages. Cumulative IVGP was fitted to a single-pool nonlinear regression model: Y = MAX x (1 - e ([-K x (t - lag)])) where Y = cumulative gas produced (mL), MAX = maximum cumulative gas produced with infinite incubation time (mL), K = rate constant, t = incubation time (h), and lag = discrete lag time (h). Generally, cumulative IVGP after 12, 24, 36, or 48 h within high-NDF fall-oat forages was negatively correlated with NDF, hemicellulose, lignin, and ash, but positively correlated with WSC, nonfiber carbohydrate (NFC), and total digestible nutrients (TDN). For low-NDF fall-grown oat forages, IVGP was positively correlated with growth stage, canopy height, WSC, NFC, and TDN; negative correlations were observed with ash and crude protein (CP) but not generally with fiber components. These responses were also reflected in multiple regression analysis for high- and low-NDF forages. After 12, 24, or 36 h of incubation, cumulative IVGP within high-NDF fall-oat forages was explained by complex regression equations utilizing (lignin:NDF)(2), lignin:NDF, hemicellulose, lignin, and TDN2 as independent variables (R-2 >= 0.43). Within low-NDF fall-grown oat forages, cumulative IVGP at these incubation intervals was explained by positive linear relationships with NFC that also exhibited high coefficients of determination (R-2 >= 0.75).

"The soluble fibre (1 -> 3)(1 -> 4)-beta-D-glucan attenuates postprandial glycaemic responses when administered in solution. This attenuating effect is strengthened when solution viscosity is increased by increasing the beta-glucan dose or molecular weight (MW). The effect of varying solution viscosity by changing solution volume, without changing the beta-glucan dose or MW, on glycaemic responses was determined. A total of fifteen healthy subjects received six 50 g oral glucose beverages prepared with or without 4 g of high-MW (HMW, 580 000 g/mol) or low-MW (LMW, 145 000 g/mol) beta-glucan, with a beverage volume of 250 or 600 ml. Postprandial plasma glucose concentration was measured over 2 h, and the peak blood glucose rise (PBGR) and the incremental area under the glycaemic response curve (AUC) were calculated. Subjects served as their own controls. The physico-chemical properties of the beverages were measured to examine their relationship with glycaemic response results. The HMW beta-glucan beverage was more viscous and achieved greater reductions in PBGR than the glucose beverage with LMW beta-glucan (P<0.05). At the same MW, the 250 and 600 ml beta-glucan beverages differed in viscosity (>9-fold difference) but not in PBGR (P>0.05). No differences in AUC were detected among the beverages (P=0.147). The effects of beta-glucan on glycaemic response were altered by changes in beverage viscosity achieved through changes in MW but not in volume. Therefore, beta-glucan dose and MW are the most vital characteristics for optimising the bioactivity of beta-glucan solutions with respect to glycaemic response.",533,1,1,99,99,99,2,0,0,3,245
"Fermented foods have a great significance since they provide and preserve large quantities of nutritious foods in a wide diversity of flavors, aromas and texture, which enrich the human diet. Originally fermented milks were developed as a means of preserving nutrients and are the most representatives of the category. The first aim of this study was to screen the effect of buckwheat flour and oat bran as prebiotics on the production of probiotic fiber-enriched fermented milks, by investigating the kinetics of acidification of buckwheat flour- and oat bran-supplemented milk fermented by Lactobacillus rhamnosus IMC 501 (R), Lactobacillus paracasei IMC 502 (R) and their 1:1 combination named SYNBIO (R). The probiotic strains viability, pH and sensory characteristics of the fermented fiber-enriched milk products, stored at 4 degrees C for 28 days were also monitored. The results showed that supplementation of whole milk with the tested probiotic strains and the two vegetable substrates results in a significant faster lowering of the pH. Also, the stability of L rhamnosus IMC 501 (R), L paracasei IMC 502 (R) and SYNBIO (R) during storage at 4 degrees C for 28 days in buckwheat flour- and oat bran-supplemented samples was remarkably enhanced.

The samples were analysed by real-time PCR for the specific infection level of seven Fusarium species associated with oats and other cereals (Fusarium poae, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium langsethiae, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium tricinctum, Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium avenaceum) and with a multi-mycotoxin method based on liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) for the detection of many fungal metabolites, including deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA), nivalenol (NIV), T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxins, moniliformin (MON), beauvericin (BEA) and enniatins (ENNs). Most samples contained at least four of the seven Fusarium species analysed and F. poae, F. langsethiae and F. avenaceum were present in approximately 90-100% of all samples. The most common toxins detected were DON, NIV, BEA and ENNs, which were present in more than 90% of samples. Most Fusarium species and their toxins occurred in higher concentrations in 2010 than in 2011, with the exception of DON and its main producer F. graminearum. Significant regional differences were detected for some moulds and mycotoxins, with higher levels of F. graminearum, DON and ZEA in western Sweden than in the east (P < 0.05) and higher levels of F. tricinctum and MON in the south (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between many Fusarium species and toxin levels. For example, F. tricinctum was significantly correlated to F. avenaceum (r = 0.72, P < 0.001), DON to ZEA (r = 0.52,P < 0.001), DON to F. graminearum (r = 0.77, P < 0.001) and the sum of T-2 and HT-2 to F. langsethiae (r = 0.77, P < 0.001).

"beta-Glucans are known to exhibit hypocholesterolemic effects. Increased intestinal viscosity is thought to be crucial for cholesterol lowering. It is suggested that concentration, molecular mass, and structure, including the ratio of (1 -> 3) to (1 -> 4) glucan bonds in the molecule, are of importance for beta-glucan functionality. This study investigated the effects of 3 different beta-glucan sources, incorporated into a beverage and yogurt, on blood lipids and fecal endpoints. Fourteen participants completed this randomized, crossover, single-blinded study with four 3-wk periods: control and 3.3 g/d oat, barley, and barley mutant beta-glucans of similar molecular mass. Before and after each period, fasting and postprandial blood samples were drawn and 3-d fecal samples were collected. Treatment did not affect changes in total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol compared with control; however, consumption of 3.3 g/d of oat beta-glucans for 3 wk resulted in greater decreases in total (-0.29 +/- 0.09 mmol/L, P < 0.01), LDL (-0.23 +/- 0.07 mmol/L, P < 0.01), and HDL (-0.05 +/- 0.03 mmol/L, P < 0.05) cholesterol compared with baseline. Changes in LDL in the beta-glucan treatments were not related to beta-glucan structure (cellotriosyl:cellotetraosyl). Decreases in fasting triacylglycerol were substantially greater after oat beta-glucan treatment compared with control (P = 0.031 Fecal dry and wet weight, stool frequency, fecal pH, and energy excretion were unaffected. The results do not fully support the hypocholesterolemic effects by differently structured oat and barley beta-glucans. However, substantial differences compared with baseline suggest a potential for oat beta-glucan, presumably due to its higher solubility and viscosity. This underlines the importance of elusive structural beta-glucan features for beneficial physiologic effects.",536,1,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,268
"Pasting and rheological properties of four oat hydrocolloids with different contents of -glucan (Nutrim10, C-Trim20, C-Trim30 and C-Trim50) were characterized and compared with oat bran concentrate (OBC) and -glucan 95%. C-Trim30 and C-Trim50 had significantly higher water-holding capacities compared with the other samples. Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA; Perten Scientific, Springfield, IL) results showed that the highest pasting parameters were found for -glucan 95% and C-Trim50 followed by C-Trim30, C-Trim20, Nutrim10 and OBC. All products exhibited frequency-dependent viscoelastic properties and shear-thinning behaviors. Both the linear and nonlinear studies were found to be related to -glucan contents with exclusion of OBC. The viscosity was lower for OBC by RVA analysis but showed higher viscoelastic property because OBC was not processed with hydrothermal shearing. These results may contribute to the use of OBC and oat bran hydrocolloids for healthy functional foods. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONSThe properties of these functional hydrocolloids could be valuable for developing new functional foods. C-Trim50 and C-Trim30 have pasting qualities that could be very useful for products such as yogurt, instant puddings, custard, batter smoothies and ice cream. The properties of C-Trim 20, Nutrim10 and OBC appear to be more suitable for food products such as baking products. OBC and the oat bran hydrocolloids all appear to have great potential in functional foods for health-concerned consumers.",537,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,215
"We previously reported that two substrains of C57BL/6 mice respond differently to oats with respect to reduction in plasma cholesterol. Analysis of this difference might offer clues to mechanisms behind the cholesterol-lowering effect of oats. Here, we address the possible roles of hepatic steroid metabolism and the intestinal microbiota in this respect. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed an atherogenic diet with oat bran (27 %) or control fibres for 4 weeks. C57BL/6 NCrl mice responded to oat bran with 19 +/- A 1 % (P < 0.001) lower plasma cholesterol, 40 +/- A 5 % (P < 0.01) higher excretion of bile acids and increased expression of the bile acid-producing hepatic enzymes CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, but none of these effects were found in C57BL/6JBomTac mice. However, on control diet, C57BL/6JBomTac had tenfold higher expression of CYP7A1 and levels of hepatic cholesterol esters than C57BL/6NCrl mice. Plasma levels of fructosamine indicated improved glycemic control by oat bran in C57BL/6NCrl but not in C57BL/6JBomTac. C57BL/6JBomTac had higher intestinal microbiota diversity, but lower numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, Akkermansia and Bacteroides Fragilis than C57BL/6NCrl mice. Oat bran increased bacterial numbers in both substrains. Microbiota diversity was reduced by oats in C57BL/6JBomTac, but unaffected in C57BL/6NCrl. Our data do not support a connection between altered microbiota diversity and reduced plasma cholesterol, but the bacterial composition in the intestine may influence the effects of added fibres. The cholesterol-lowering properties of oats involve increased production of bile acids via the classical pathway with up-regulation of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1. Altered cholesterol or bile acid metabolism may interfere with the potential of oats to reduce plasma cholesterol.",538,1,1,0,1,-1,3,1,1,0,267
"Oats contain ingredients that have potential health-promoting properties. Oat lipids contain several essential fatty acids. The polar lipids in oats include glycolipids and phospholipids, which are typically extracted from oat flakes with polar organic solvents. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) has been proposed as an alternative to organic solvents in the food sector for environmental and safety reasons. SC-CO2 was used in this study without and with ethanol as a co-solvent to isolate the polar lipid fractions from oat flakes with or without heat treatments. The polar lipids were collected as a solution in ethanol and precipitated using SC-CO2 as an antisolvent. The fatty acid compositions of different lipid fractions were determined. The precipitated oat polar lipids were tested as an encapsulative and protective agent of probiotics in a human digestive tract simulation. The protective effects of the oat polar lipids were evaluated by measuring the gas production, microbial activity, acetic and lactic acid production, and pH changes in different test mediums. The results demonstrate that the oat polar lipids are able to protect Bifidobacterium breve in a phosphate buffer, thereby providing a useful stabilization method to improve the shelf life of probiotic products.

"The concept of this study was to develop a low-in-oil salad dressing emulsion, based on oat flour, that combines the flour health-promoting potential of fibre and growth support of the probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei DC412 with the functional properties of oat flour e.g. emulsion stabilization and thickening ability. Probiotic viability, following emulsion storage and enzymatic treatment, was sustained in presence of oat flour at levels close to those found for inulin. The dressing emulsion was further investigated by applying response surface methodology to establish the relationships between the main factors (storage time, and oil, xanthan and oat flour content), on one hand, and the response variables (probiotic cell count before and after treatment with gastrointestinal track enzyme fluids, consistency index (K), and mean droplet diameter (d(43)), on the other. The optimum formulation (g/100 g) found was: oil (20), xanthan (0.475) and oat flour (3.0); viable cell counts of emulsions after 7.5 weeks of refrigerated storage and treatment with simulated gastric and intestinal juices reached levels as high as 10(8) cfu/g. In addition to enhancing cell viability, oat flour incorporation led to an appreciable improvement of the emulsion rheological properties and physical stability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is part of the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, there are few suitable animal models to study the pathogenesis of NASH or very limited advances in the prevention. Our aims were to establish a mouse model of NASH by intraperitoneally injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 1.5 mg per kg body weight per day for 6 weeks and to investigate the potential inhibitory effects of oat beta-glucan (1%, 5%, or 10%) added to a specific pathogen-free diet. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS for 6 weeks increased serum LPS levels; decreased serum glucagon-like peptide-2 levels; triggered abnormal aminotransferase activity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance; and increased hepatic proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta), triglyceride, and malonyl dialdehyde levels; but reduced hepatic superoxide dismutase activity. Histologic evaluation revealed evidence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and mild necrosis in LPS-treated mice. Dietary supplementation of oat beta-glucan prevented most of the LPS-induced metabolic disorders, and improved hepatic steatosis and inflammation, although a dose-dependent effect was not observed. In conclusion, oat beta-glucan could inhibit LPS-induced NASH in mice.",541,1,99,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,179
"In this study, we investigated the influence of organic and conventional farming systems on mycotoxin levels in oats from 2006 to 2008. The relationship between mycotoxin contents was also calculated. Data were analysed separately for each factor (year three values and production systems two values) and their combinations, e.g. analysis of samples harvested in entire three-year period of this study from organic farming. Only one significant difference occurred between organic and conventional farming systems when samples from entire three-year period of this study were included the concentration of diacetoscirpenol (DAS) was higher in samples from conventional farms. Statistical analysis did not reveal any influence of the cropping system on the concentrations of remaining mycotoxins. However, the number of mycotoxin-positive samples was higher in organic farming in comparison to conventional production. Furthermore, considering only the mycotoxin-positive samples, the concentrations of deoxynivalenol (DON), T-2, HT-2, DAS, nivalenol (NIV), and aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1 and G2) were slightly higher, but not statistically significant, in samples from conventional farming. Most correlations of the mycotoxin content occurred in oat grain samples from organic rather than conventional farms. Numerous positive correlations were found between NIV and DAS and between NIV, DAS and other mycotoxins. Only one low negative correlation was detected for the concentration of DON and NIV when all samples from organic production system were considered. Low and moderate positive correlations were found between aflatoxins, ochratoxins and other mycotoxins. The level of aflatoxins and ochratoxins was correlated only in samples from organic farming. This is one of the few reports presenting correlations between mycotoxins on the background of organic and conventional farming systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Dietary fibre has a beneficial effect on metabolic syndrome, e.g. by influencing the absorption of glucose. The source and structure of fibre affect the glucose response. In this study, the glycaemic and insulinaemic response to oat bread, oat bread with lingonberry fibre, oat-buckwheat bread and buckwheat porridge were tested in a small-scale clinical study (KHSHP E514/09). Nine healthy volunteers consumed test foods after overnight fasting. Serum glucose and C-peptide levels were determined by colorimetric and ELISA methods, respectively, from samples taken at seven time points during 120 min. The mean glycaemic and C-peptide indexes (C-pepIs) were 32 and 100 for oat bread, 47 and 119 for oat-lingonberry fibre bread, 58 and 105 for oat-buckwheat bread and 71 and 77 for buckwheat porridge. Similar to rye, buckwheat porridge having a relatively high glycaemic index (GI) tended to have a low C-pepI.

"Objective: The physicochemical properties of soluble oat fiber (beta-glucan) affect viscosity-dependent mechanisms that influence satiety. The objective of this study was to compare the satiety impact of oatmeal with the most widely sold ready-to-eat breakfast cereal (RTEC) when either was consumed as a breakfast meal. Methods: Forty-eight healthy individuals >= 18 years of age were enrolled in a randomized crossover trial. Following an overnight fast, subjects consumed either oatmeal or RTEC in random order at least a week apart. The breakfasts were isocaloric and contained 363 kcal (250 kcal cereal, 113 kcal milk). Visual analogue scales measuring appetite and satiety were completed before breakfast and throughout the morning. The content and physicochemical properties of oat beta-glucan were determined. Appetite and satiety responses were analyzed by area under the curve (AUC). Physicochemical properties were analyzed using t tests. Results: Oatmeal, higher in fiber and protein but lower in sugar than the RTEC, resulted in greater increase in fullness (AUC: p = 0.005 [120 minute: p = 0.0408, 180 minute: p = 0.0061, 240 minute: p = 0.0102]) and greater reduction in hunger (AUC: p = 0.0009 [120 minute: p = 0.0197, 180 minute: p = 0.0003, 240 minute: p = 0.0036]), desire to eat (AUC: p = 0.0002 [120 minute: p = 0.0168, 180 minute: p < 0.0001, 240 minute: p = 0.0022]), and prospective intake (AUC: p = 0.0012 [120 minute: p = 0.0058, 180 minute: p = 0.006, 240 minute: p = 0.0047]) compared to the RTEC. Oatmeal had higher beta-glucan content, higher molecular weight (p < 0.0001), higher viscosity (p = 0.025), and larger hydration spheres (p = 0.0012) than the RTEC. Conclusion: Oatmeal improves appetite control and increases satiety. The effects may be attributed to the viscosity and hydration properties of its beta-glucan content.",544,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,297
"The ability of oat foods to lower serum cholesterol and post-prandial blood glucose concentrations. has been linked to the physicochemical properties of the bioactive component, mixed linkage beta-glucan. Oat foods frequently need to be shipped or stored prior to analysis and beta-glucan characteristics may change over time. Reductions in beta-glucan solubility or molecular weight lead to lower viscosity development which decreases bioactivity. Impact of freezing and freeze drying conditions on the beta-glucan physicochemical characteristics in oat bran bread and porridge were studied. Two in vitro digestibility methods were used to produce physiological extracts and the results were compared. The beta-glucan molecular weight, solubility and viscosity for oat bread stored at room temperature were unchanged for 3 days, followed by a gradual decline in these parameters. The extract viscosity for bread decreased significantly after freezing at -80 degrees C and freeze drying after freezing at -18 and -80 degrees C, whereas freezing in liquid nitrogen did not significantly influence viscosity. Freezing of oat bran porridge did not affect extract viscosity, but freeze drying resulted in reduction of extract viscosity compared to the fresh porridge. Freezing and freeze drying did not dramatically affect the molecular weight or solubility of beta-glucan in either product. The rapid visco analyzer was more effective and reliable for sample digestion than when physiological extraction was conducted in the shaking water bath. Generally, freezing at -18 degrees C or by submersion in liquid nitrogen maintained the physicochemical characteristics of beta-glucan in food products either for commercial products or subsequent analysis.

"This study examined antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of medium oat bran treated with four polysaccharide enzymes viscozyme, cellulase, alpha-amylase, and amyloglucosidase. The effects of these enzymes on the release of phenolic acids were determined using reverse-phase HPLC chromatography. Antioxidant assays showed that enzyme pre-treatments significantly increased the hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) scavenging activity of all bran samples (16.6-20.0 mu M propyl gallate equivalents (PGE)/g bran) relative to untreated bran (13.3 +/- 1.8 mu M PGE/g). The order of activity was cellulase approximate to viscozyme > amyloglucosidase approximate to alpha-amylase. The DPPH free radical inhibitory activities of brans pre-treated with cellulase and amyloglucosidase, 43.0% and 45.0%, respectively were higher than inhibition by untreated bran 21.7% (P < 0.05). In the linoleic acid (LA) autoxidation assay, three of the treated and untreated brans similarly inhibited LA oxidation, while viscozyme pre-treated bran had no activity. HPLC analysis showed an increase in free phenolic acids, and this was more pronounced for ferulic and caffeic acids. In the antimicrobial assay, brans pre-treated with viscozyme and cellulase similarly inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli compared to untreated bran (P < 0.05), while viscozyme- and alpha-amylase-treated brans enhanced the growth of Bacillus subtilis, a non-pathogenic bacteria strain that has been used as a pro-biotic.

"Oats are gaining increasing scientific and public interest for their purported antioxidant-associated health benefits. Most reported studies focused on specific oat extracts or particular oat components, such as beta-glucans, tocols (vitamin E), or avenanthramides. Studies on whole oats with respect to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are still lacking. Here the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities from whole oat groats of seven common varieties were evaluated. All oat varieties had very similar oxygen radical absorption capacity compared with other whole grains. In an anti-inflammatory assay, oat variety CDC Dancer inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced nuclear factor-kappa B activation by 27.5% at 2 mg/ml, whereas variety Deiter showed 13.7% inhibition at a comparable dose. Avenanthramide levels did not correlate with the observed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

"Specific dietary requirements, e.g. celiac disease, as well as increased consumer demand for products of high nutritional value, makes the production of pasta from alternative cereals interesting. Raw material characterisation showed that the utilisation of oat and teff flour is beneficial as these ingredients contain higher levels of fibre and mineral composition is superior to that of wheat. Starch properties significantly influence pasta quality and therefore damaged starch levels, amylase activity, pasting properties and gelatinisation temperatures of the flours were investigated. Fresh egg pasta based on wheat, oat and teff flour was produced. Sensory properties of oat spaghetti were found to be very close to that of wheat pasta but improvement of smoothness and aroma is necessary, while teff spaghetti showed reduced sensory quality. An in vitro enzymatic digestion was performed using a dialysis system to mimic the behaviour of pasta as eaten and make predictions on the glycemic index (GI). The predicted GI was highest for wheat pasta, followed by teff and oat. Ultra structure was studied using confocal laser scanning microscopy, allowing the visualisation of differences in starch granule size and shape as well as gelatinisation occurring during the cooking process.

"Oat is widely consumed by people with celiac disease (CD). Its safety has been disputed because two peptides from oat avenins can be recognized as T cell epitopes by some CD patients. Differential signals of gluten-specific monoclonal antibodies and in-vitro T cells to oat varieties have suggested the existence of differences in immunogenicity. We aimed to clarify the nature of such responses by cloning avenin genes from 13 Avena species. A single oat plant contained up to 10 avenin genes. Avenin proteins clustered in four groups of which two contained the two avenin CD epitopes. All Avena species examined harbored avenins of these two groups, and as a consequence all contained avenins with the two avenin-specific epitopes, which makes it very unlikely to find oat cultivars that are devoid of these sequences. The established gluten epitopes from wheat, rye and barley were not present in oat avenins; some variants with two and three amino acid substitutions occurred, but they were predicted not to resist proteolysis in the gastro-intestinal tract. Perfect recognition sites of antibodies R5 and G12 were also not present in avenins. Thus, their signals to oat should not be interpreted as differences in immunogenicity for CD patients.

"Harvest samples of common wheat (Triticum aestivum), oats (Avena sativa), and rye (Secale cereale) from producers in western Canada were analyzed for fungal infection by toxigenic Fusarium species and contamination by trichothecenes and moniliformin (MON). Fusarium graminearum and F. avenaceum were the two most frequently isolated species from samples of rye and wheat collected in 2010. F. poae and F. sporotrichioides were more commonly detected in randomly selected oat seeds. Other toxigenic Fusarium species including F. acuminatum, F. culmorum, and E pseudograminearum as well as Phaeosphaeria nodorum (a.k.a. Septoria nodorum) were recovered primarily from fusarium-damaged kernels of wheat Pure cultures of F. avenaceum, F acuminatum, and other related species known to produce moniliformin were isolated from incubated seeds based on micro- and macromorphological criteria. The phylogenetic analysis inferred from partial DNA sequences of the acl1 and tef-1 alpha genes revealed two major clades representing F. avenaceum and F. acurninatum, respectively. These clades comprised all Canadian isolates of the two species and a number of reference cultures studied earlier for their propensity to form moniliformin in vitro and in planta. However, some reference cultures previously reported to produce significant amounts of moniliformin formed minor phylogenetic lineages that represent rather distinct but closely related species. Concomitantly, cereal samples were analyzed for the presence of deoxynivalenol and moniliformin. These two Fusarium toxins were observed most frequently in common wheat, at concentrations up to 1.1 and 4.0 mg/kg, respectively., There was no apparent relationship between moniliformin concentrations and detection of F. avenaceum and F. acuminatum in rye and oat samples.

"The oat grain is often subjected to different hydrothermal treatments to inactivate hydrolytic enzymes that can have undesirable effects on the end-product quality. Hydrothermal treatments may affect the functional properties of oat starch. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of eight different hydrothermal treatments on the physicochemical and digestibility properties of oat starch. Hydrothermal treatments were selected based on heat treatment applications in oat industry and listed as HT-1) Ethanol boil HT-2) Ethanol boil and toasted HT-3) Steamed at 106 degrees C HT-4) Steamed at 106 degrees C and toasted HT-5) Covered autoclaved at 120 degrees C HT-6) Uncovered autoclaved at 120 degrees C HT-7) Covered autoclaved at 130 degrees C and HT-8) Uncovered autoclaved at 130 degrees C. The morphology of the oat starch was altered as a result of various heat treatments. HT-5 and HT-7 treatments had more large starch granules than the other samples, however the apparent molecular weight of the starch from these samples was unaffected by the treatment. HT-6 and HT-8 resulted in the most significant changes to the gelatinization properties of the oat starch. HT-6 oat sample had significantly (P < 0.05) lower paste viscosity than starches from the oat samples with other treatments. The in vitro starch digestibility increased significantly (P < 0.05) for the HT-6 and HT-8 oat samples. This study demonstrated that thermal treatments can cause reorganization of the amylose and amylopectin chains that can result in changes in their physicochemical and digestibility properties.

"The effect of acid- or enzyme-catalysed hydrolysis on partial depolymerisation of beta-glucan in oat bran was studied. Hydrolyses were performed at relatively low water content (50% dry matter) using high shear mixing in a twin-screw extruder. The hydrolysed oat brans were extracted with hot water and centrifuged to obtain a water-soluble phase and an insoluble residue. The time-dependent gelling of the water-soluble phase was monitored for 14 weeks at 5 degrees C. Acid-hydrolysis required a short reaction time (3 min) to depolymerise the beta-glucan molecules from their original average M-w of 780,000 to 34,000 g/mol. After acid-hydrolysis, beta-glucan had low polydispersity (4.0-6.7). Longer incubation time (3-4 h) was needed for enzymatic depolymerisation of the p-glucan molecules down to 71,000-49,000 g/mol. Enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in high polydispersity (19.0-242). The concentration and M-w of p-glucan significantly affected the gelling of hot water extracts. At 1.4-2.0% beta-glucan concentration, solutions of beta-glucan molecules with Mw > 50,000 g/mol agglomerated rapidly, whereas solutions of smaller molecules (34,000-49,000 g/mol) remained as stable dispersions for longer. Gelling was strongly concentration-dependent and at 1.4 to 1.6% beta-glucan concentration gelling occurred after 7 to 12 weeks of storage, whereas at 1.8 to 1.9% concentration gelling occurred already after 2 weeks of storage.

"Brewing with high levels of unmalted oats (Avena sativa) has proven to be successful despite their high contents of beta-glucan, protein, and fat. However, little is known about the effect of different oat cultivars on the quality and processability of mashes and worts. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the mashing performance of eight oat cultivars, selected because of their low contents of beta-glucan, protein, fat, and/or high starch content, when substituting 20 or 40 % barley malt. For this purpose, seven husked (A. sativa L. 'Lutz', 'Buggy', 'Galaxy', 'Scorpion', 'Typhon', 'Ivory', 'Curly') and one naked oat cultivar (A. sativa var. nuda 'NORD 07/711') were fully characterized using standard methods, Lab-on-a-Chip capillary electrophoresis, and scanning electron microscopy. The rheological behavior of mashes containing up to 40 % of each oat cultivar was measured during mashing by applying a Physica MCR rheometer. In addition, the quality of worts obtained from laboratory-scale mashing trials was analyzed particularly with regard to their cytolytic, proteolytic, and amylolytic properties. The substitution of up to 40 % barley malt with husked or naked oats resulted in significantly higher pH values, beta-glucan contents, and viscosities as well as significantly lower soluble nitrogen and polyphenol contents, color values, filtration rates, and apparent attenuation limits. Naked oats contained significantly less beta-glucan as well as more protein and starch than the seven husked oat cultivars. The replacement of barley malt with naked oats resulted in a constant extract yield, whereas the use of husked oats caused significant extract losses.",554,1,0,1,99,1,3,0,1,1,252
"Challenges and opportunities of minor cereals with poor viscoelastic value deserve a special attention in breadmaking applications due to their unique nutritional components. In a preliminary stage, the suitability of oat, millet and sorghum in breadmaking was assessed in simple binary wheat flour matrices in which wheat flour was replaced from 0% to 60%. The research allowed the quantification of grains (up to 30% for millet and sorghum and up to 50% for oat of wheat flour replacement) to be incorporated into the binary blended matrices providing minimization of techno-functional impairment and sensory depreciation of breads. Combinations of gluten, vegetable fat and a commercial mix of surfactants, ascorbic acid and antistaling enzymes were used to make breads with 10% increased level of wheat flour replacement by single oat, millet and sorghum in binary mixed samples. The quality profile of binary mixtures of oat-wheat (60:40 w/w), millet-wheat (40:60 w/w) and sorghum-wheat (40:60 w/w) was significantly improved in terms of keepability during storage, mainly for oat-wheat blends which stale at a similar rate than 100% wheat breads. Overall acceptability of highly replaced wheat breads deserved higher scores for oat and sorghum composite breads (7/10) than control wheat breads (6/10).

Incorporating oat flours to wheat increased total phenolic content but lowered the antioxidant activity however both were decreased significantly upon baking. The reducing power of the oat blended flour was higher than the wheat flours and ranged from 8.0 to 15.5 mu mol AAE/g and was further increased upon baking. The metal chelating activity of flour blends varied from 62.0% to 73.8% and further increased upon baking. After baking the total flavonoid content was lowered and ranged from 308 to 389 mu g CE/g.

"Few data were available on the interactions between polyphenols and polysaccharides. The effects of the chemical structure of polyphenols on their interactions with oat beta-glucan were analyzed. Ultrafiltration was applied to determine the adsorption capacities of polyphenols into oat beta-glucan. Hydroxylation favored the adsorption of flavonoids with three or fewer hydroxyl groups but deteriorated those with four or more hydroxyl groups. Among flavonoid isomers, the adsorption capacities increased in the order flavonol > flvaone > flavanone > isoflavone. Glycosylation exerted complicated influences on the adsorption capacities of flavonoids into oat beta-glucan. In most cases, methylation and methoxylation of phenolic acids lowered their adsorption capacities into oat beta-glucan. Esterification of gallic acid weakened its adsorption capacity into oat beta-glucan, whereas o-coumaric acid presented higher adsorption capacity into oat beta-glucan than p- and m-coumaric acids. Galloylation improved the adsorption capacities of catechins into oat beta-glucan.",557,99,99,1,0,1,2,0,1,2,143
"The aim this work was to establish the best conditions to increase the soluble dietary fiber (SDF), evaluate the effect of extrusion on the SDF, and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF), in a snack obtained by extrusion, that serve as a source of calcium and DF, using mixtures of oat-corn pericarp. The corn pericarp was obtained from byproduct of nixtamalization process which contains water, calcium hydroxide, soluble solids, and pericarp. The studied parameters were temperature (120-140 degrees C), moisture (200-400 g/kg), and corn pericarp (200-400 g/kg); the responses were expansion ratio, SDF, IDF, and water absorption index (WAI). The R-2 were>0.85 for all factors. The best conditions were temperature (133 degrees C), moisture (230 g/kg), and corn pericarp (300 g/kg), with responses of 93.1 g/kg increase in SDF, 60 g/kg decrease of IDF, expansion of 1.26, WAI of 4.12 g sediment/g dry solid, and calcium content 4350 mg/kg.",558,99,99,0,0,99,0,0,2,3,147
"We report the first discovery of lunasin in oats (Avena sativa L). Lunasin is a novel cancer preventive, anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-reducing peptide originally isolated from soy and later found in cereals (barley, rye, wheat, triticale). Lunasin was detected in oats using LC-MS/MS analysis. The chromatograms and mass spectra of lunasin isolated from five oat genotypes were compared with those of the synthetic lunasin peptide. We measured the lunasin content in harvests of two years and found that all tested oat genotypes contained the lunasin peptide. However, we observed genotype-related fluctuations in the lunasin content. Notably, the middle early oat variety 'Ivory' contained the highest and the most stable lunasin level at 0.197 +/- 0.01 mg per g of grain in year 2010 and 0.195 +/- 0.009 mg per g of grain in 2011. We also characterized the selected oat genotypes by measuring the contents of protein, beta-glucans, fat, starch and moisture in the grains. However, we did not find correlation between lunasin and protein, and beta-glucan content. Lunasin isolated from oat showed similar to the synthetic lunasin antioxidant effects. The detection of lunasin complements a list of bioactive compounds present in oats and strengthens recommendations to use oat products. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Oat could be a good addition to the Gluten Free diet, but the purity of the oat supply is under scrutiny. As celiac disease becomes more prevalent, better detection tools for gluten in oats are necessary. We aimed to produce reference materials (RMs) of Canada Western Red Spring wheat (CWRS)-contaminated oat flour. Pure, uncontaminated oats flour (cultivars Navan and Gehl) was supplied by Cream Hill Estates. CWRS samples were provided by the Canadian Grain Commission from the 2009 Harvest Sample program. RMs containing 0, 20 and 100 ppm CWRS gluten-contaminated oats were created using a V-shell blender and tested by sandwich-type ELISA for gluten. Marked variations in ELISA results for the RMs were found among different test kits due to differences in capture antibodies and kit construction. The Veratox test was accurate at the 0, 20 and 100 ppm levels but detected only 30% (Veratox) and 50% (Veratox R5) of gluten at the 1000 ppm level; the Ridascreen test was accurate at all levels; the Biokits test detected roughly 10% of the gluten dosage; the Gluten-Check test detected some 30% of the gluten dosage. The RMs created could serve as standards for gluten detection in oat containing foods. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",560,0,0,0,1,99,1,0,3,1,209
"The potential of VIS-NIR spectroscopy as a rapid screening method for resistance of Fusarium-inoculated oats to replace the costly chemical measurements of deoxynivalenol (DON) was investigated. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was conducted on second-derivative spectra (400-2,350 nm) of 166 DON-contaminated samples (0.05-28.1 ppm, mean = 13.06 ppm) with separate calibration and test set samples. The calibration set had 111 samples, and the test set had 55 samples. The best model developed had three PLS components and a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 3.16 ppm. The residual predictive deviation (RPD) value of the prediction model was 2.63, an acceptable value for the purpose of rough screening. Visual inspection and the VIS spectra of the samples revealed that high-DON samples tended to be darker in color and coarser in texture compared with low-DON samples. The second-derivative spectra showed that low-DON samples tended to have more water and fat content than high-DON samples. With an RMSEP value of 3.16 and RPD of value of 2.63, it seems possible to use VIS-NIR spectroscopy to semiquantitatively estimate DON content of oats and discard the worst genotypes during the early stages of screening.",561,99,99,99,-1,99,0,1,0,4,191
"C-trim is a healthy food product containing soluble dietary fibre beta-glucan. The dispersion of C-trim in water is a hydrocolloid biopolymer. The linear and non-linear rheological properties of dispersions of C-trim biopolymers were investigated. The linear viscoelastic behaviours for C-trim dispersions were dependent on the beta-glucan that C-trim contained. The C-trim20 and C-trim30, which have about 20% and 30% beta-glucan, respectively, exhibited more fluid-like behaviours. The C-trim50 and C-trim95, which contain about 50% and 95% beta-glucan, respectively, showed solid viscoelastic properties. The power law model fitting, as well as spectra, for the linear dynamic frequency sweep and stress relaxation of C-trim dispersions, suggested that the C-trim dispersions were composed of physical entanglement networks instead of chemical cross ones. The non-linear steady shearing studies for C-trim dispersions indicated that all four of the C-trim dispersions exhibited shear-thinning behaviours, which could be best described by the power law model.

"The isothermal phase behaviour at 5 degrees C of mixtures of sodium caseinate and oat beta-glucan isolates varying in molecular weight (MW) was investigated by means of phase diagram construction, rheometry, fluorescence microscopy and electrophoresis. Phase diagrams indicated that the compatibility of the beta-glucan/sodium caseinate system increases as beta-glucan MW decreases. Images of mixtures taken at various biopolymer concentrations revealed phase separated domains. Results also revealed that at the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, lower MW samples yielded considerable viscosity in the mixture. At equivalent hydrodynamic volume of beta-glucan in the mixtures, samples varying in molecular weight exhibited similar flow behaviour. A deviation dependent on the protein concentration was observed for the high MW sample in the concentrated regime due to the size of beta-glucan aggregates formed. Results demonstrate that by controlling the structural features of beta-glucan in mixtures with sodium caseinate, informed manipulation of rheological properties in these systems can be achieved.

"The impacts of the molecular weight (MW), viscosity, and solubility of beta-glucan on the rate of in vitro starch digestion and estimated glycemic index (GI) were evaluated. Extracted oat starch and beta-glucan suspensions with high, medium, and low MW were heated to gelatinize the starch. The viscosity increased and the solubility decreased with an increase in the MW of beta-glucan. The in vitro starch hydrolysis of the mixtures and a control, white bread, increased as the digestion time increased. As the MW of beta-glucan increased, the starch hydrolysis decreased during in vitro digestion. The in vitro estimated GI of the mixture without beta-glucan, determined from the starch hydrolysis rate, was 88.3 for Jim and 80.0 for N979, which decreased to 68.4 and 66.8, respectively, with the inclusion of high-MW beta-glucan. The estimated GI values were negatively correlated with the beta-glucan peak and final viscosities (r = -0.81 and -0.82). These results illustrated the importance of viscosity attributed to the beta-glucan MW on starch hydrolysis during in vitro digestion. These findings will help to develop new food products with a low GI by using oat beta-glucan.",564,1,1,1,99,1,4,0,0,1,185
"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of oatmeal and palm fat in the elaboration of biscuits with added L-leucine and calcium in order to develop a product for sarcopenia in the elderly. The biscuits, or cookies, were elaborated applying a central composite rotational design with surface response methodology, and the significant linear, quadratic and interaction terms were used in the second order mathematical model. Physical, physicochemical and sensory analyses were performed by a trained panel. Based on the best results obtained, three cookie formulations were selected for sensory evaluation by the target group and physicochemical determinations. The formulations with the highest sensory scores for appearance and texture and medium scores for color and expansion index were selected. The addition of calcium and leucine increased significantly the concentration of these components in the biscuits elaborated resulting in a cookie with more than 30% of DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) for calcium and leucine. The formulations selected showed high acceptance by the target group; therefore, they can be included in the diet of elderly with sarcopenia as a functional food.",565,1,99,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,184
"Oats have a high content of -glucan soluble fiber. Consumption of it helps to reduce cholesterol, glycemic response and some intestinal diseases. Oats flour was used to substitute 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the wheat flour to elaborate cakes with different sugar content (6090120% flour basis). Specific volume and viscosity were studied in batters and specific volume, weight loss, symmetry index and texture in cakes. The higher the substitution percentage, the higher the specific volume and viscosity of the batter in those formulas containing less sugar. Sugar content did not affect batter specific volume but batter viscosity decreased with increasing sugar percentages. Cake specific volume decreased as the percentage of whole oats flour increased, and cake hardness, cohesiveness and springiness decreased as oats flour increased. The cakes obtained adequate acceptability by consumers. Practical Applications This paper demonstrates the influence of the addition of oat flour in cake making, as well as its interaction with the sugar content in formula. Less sugar content (60 and 90% f/b) is needed to increase specific volume of batters with wheat and oat flours. Viscosity decreased as the percentage of oats flour increased in high-sugar ratio (120/100) formula, whereas in low-ratio formula the opposite effect was observed. Based on the conclusions, they could be optimized both, the characteristics of the batter to its correct processing as well as the sensory quality of oat flour cakes, allowing the industry to obtain healthiest cakes with greater acceptance by consumers.",566,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,243

The estimated percentage of the soluble fraction ranged from 50.7 to 87.0%. beta-glucan content and solubility were significantly influenced by both genotype and growing environment. Hierarchical cluster analysis allowed accessions with similar beta-glucan compositions to be grouped.

"Oat beta-glucan attenuates postprandial glycemic responses when solubilized to form viscous solutions. High molecular weight (MW) beta-glucan is associated with high solution viscosity, which is in turn associated with lower glycemic responses. However, low MW beta-glucan is also able to form viscoelastic gels. The effect of low (145 000 g mol(-1)) and high (580 000 g mol(-1)) MW beta-glucan presented as liquid drinks and gels on glycemic responses was determined. Healthy subjects (n = 15) consumed 50 g glucose drinks with no beta-glucan; 4 g low MW; or 4 g high MW beta-glucan; and gels containing 4 g low MW; 2 g low plus 2 g high MW; or 3 g high plus 1 g low MW beta-glucan. Overall, beta-glucan solutions elicited lower glycemic responses than gels. For gels, peak blood glucose rise (PBGR) decreased with increasing dose of high MW beta-glucan (r(2) = 0.976, P > 0.05), and PBGR for the gel with 3 g high-MW was lower than for the control (P < 0.05). However, beta-glucan gels retained glucose better than solutions under in vitro analysis. Observed effects were found to be related to the rheological properties of the foods. beta-Glucan solutions and not gels effectively attenuated in vivo glycemic responses.",569,0,0,1,1,99,2,0,2,1,203
"Obesity is associated with a great diversity of diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Our recent report suggested that oat, rich in beta-glucan, had a metabolic-regulating and liver-protecting effect in an animal model. In this study, we performed a clinical trial to further confirm the effect of oat. Subjects with BMI a parts per thousand 27 and aged 18-65, were randomly divided into a control (n = 18) and an oat-treated (n = 16) group, taking a placebo or beta glucan-containing oat cereal, respectively, for 12 weeks. Our data showed that consumption of oat reduced body weight, BMI, body fat and the waist-to-hip ratio. Profiles of hepatic function, including AST, but especially ALT, were useful resources to help in the evaluation of the liver, since both showed decrements in patients with oat consumption. Nevertheless, anatomic changes were still not observed by ultrasonic image analysis. Ingestion of oat was well tolerated and there was no adverse effect during the trial. In conclusion, consumption of oat reduced obesity, abdominal fat, and improved lipid profiles and liver functions.

"Germination can be used to improve the sensory and nutritional properties of cereal and pseudocereal grains. Oat and quinoa are rich in minerals, vitamins and fibre while quinoa also contains high amounts of protein of a high nutritional value. In this study, oat and quinoa malts were produced and incorporated in a rice and potato based gluten free formulation. Germination of oat led to a drastic increase of alpha-amylase activity from 0.3 to 48 U/g, and minor increases in proteolytic and lipolytic activities. Little change was observed in quinoa except a decrease in proteolytic activity from 9.6 to 6.9 U/g. Oat malt addition decreased batter viscosities at both proofing temperature and during heating. These changes led to a decrease in bread density from 0.59 to 0.5 g/ml and the formation of a more open crumb, but overdosing of oat malt deteriorated the product as a result of excessive amylolysis during baking. Quinoa malt had no significant effect on the baking properties due to low alpha-amylase activity. Despite showing a very different impact on the bread quality, both malts influenced the electrophoretic patterns of rice flour protein similarly. This suggests that malt induced proteolysis does not influence the technological properties of a complex gluten free formulation.",571,1,99,1,-1,99,2,1,0,2,205
"This study was conducted to evaluate concentrate level (CL) and slaughter body weight (SW) effects on growth performances, carcass traits and meat quality of Barbarine lambs. Twenty-four weaned male lambs (23.1 kg), receiving an oat-hay based diet, were allotted into two groups. The LCL group received low concentrate level (300 g) and the HCL group received high concentrate level (600 g). Lambs were slaughtered at two prefixed weights (35 and 42 kg). For each group and each weight, six lambs were slaughtered. Lambs from HCL group had higher ADG, carcass yields, carcass compactness and subcutaneous fat thickness, and lower carcass meat proportion. CL increase did not affect meat pH, meat and fat color, chemical and fatty acid composition. Late slaughtering improved carcass yields and increased carcass adiposity. However, it did not affect carcass meat proportion and shoulder tissue composition. SW had effect on meat color and fatty acid composition. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"The aflatoxins (AFs), deoxynivalenol (DON), ochratoxin A (OTA) and zearalenone (ZEA) are mycotoxins produced by fungal species which can contaminate, alone or simultaneously, cereal-based raw materials. Usually, the higher mycotoxins concentrations in cereals are found in the external layers of the grain (bran). Nowadays bran is increasingly consumed for its high fibre concentration. The objectives of this study were determining the concentration of these mycotoxins in bran samples intended for direct human consumption and to study the influence of some characteristics of the samples that may affect the mycotoxins content, there are not studies about fibre for direct human consumption. 67 bran samples from shops and supermarkets from two different Spanish cities were analyzed, being 37 samples of wheat bran and the remaining of oat bran. The results showed a major presence of DON in the analyzed samples, with levels above the EU legislation in some samples. Presence of DON was more frequent in wheat samples, compared to oats ones (p < 0.05). Extruded or toasted samples, subjected to a heat treatment during processing, presented a significantly lower concentration of OTA, and differences between the organically and conventionally produced samples were also detected in OTA, which showed higher levels in the organic samples. Co-occurrence was frequently found between the Fusarium mycotoxins (ZEA and DON). Due to the high levels of DON in the analyzed samples, a calculation of DON intake has been made and it has been demonstrated that bran can account for an important percentage of DON exposure in the total diet.

We chose six lines with an increased- and four lines with a reduced beta-glucan content for further study. By longitudinal- and cross-sections of seeds it was shown that localization of beta-glucan varied between the different lines. In addition, beta-glucan quality parameters like molecular weight and solubility were also determined. Although the selection was designed for quantitative differences, qualitative differences between the beta-glucans from the different lines were found. The high and low beta-glucan lines will now be used as a model system to study molecular regulation of beta-glucan biosynthesis as well as possible links between fibre quality and biological activity.

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance and usefulness of three rapid test kits for analysis of HT-2 and T-2 toxins (HT-2 and T-2), two of the most potent trichothecenes commonly found in European oats. Concentrations of these two toxins combined (HT-2+T-2) were analysed in naturally contaminated oat samples (n=68) using the following test kits: Ridascreen (R) FAST T-2 Toxin ('Fast ELISA'), DRAFT Ridascreen (R) HT-2/T-2 ('Standard ELISA; not commercially available), and the lateral flow device ROSA (R) HT-2-T-2 ('Rosa LFD'). Mycotoxin analysis by LC-MS/MS was used as a reference method. Rosa LFD offered the best reliability, achieving detection that was stable across toxin levels, whereas detection by both ELISA kits differed significantly among toxin levels (P<0.01). The kits were also evaluated regarding agreement with the reference method (measured as Cohen's kappa) at a HT-2+T-2 concentration of 1000 mu g/kg in naturally contaminated oats. Agreement was greatest for Rosa LFD (89.2%), intermediate for Standard ELISA (66.8%), and lowest for Fast ELISA (62.2%). Rosa LFD showed cross-reaction of 100% with both T-2 and HT-2. For the ELISA kits, cross-reactions were 100% with T-2 but below 100% with HT-2. Therefore, to estimate the sum of HT-2 and T-2 in an oat sample, it was necessary to re-calculate the data from both ELISA kits according to the known cross-reaction of each kit with HT-2 and the concentration ratio of HT-2 to T-2 in Norwegian oats. Rosa LED had the highest correlation with LC-MS/MS (R-2=0.94), and the corresponding R-2 values for Fast and Standard ELISA were 0.61 and 0.83, respectively.

The results showed that no significant differences were observed in swimming endurance test between the normal control group and the oat protein group (P > 0.05). Mice in the oat meal group had significantly longer swimming endurance compared to the normal control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, dietary oat protein increased the levels of liver glycogen, enhanced the activities of lactic dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase, and decreased the levels of blood urea nitrogen and malondialdehyde in serum.

"BACKGROUND: Steaming and roasting treatments are widely used enzyme deactivation methods in the oat food industry in China. Whether or not the enzyme deactivation treatments affect the nutritional function of oat foods is unknown. In the current study, we examined the effects of 4-week ingestion of steamed or roasted oat foods on the intestinal bacteria and short-chain fatty acids of rats. RESULTS: Compared with rats taking no oat foods, rats taking normal oat foods or enzyme-deactivated oat foods showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) counts of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. in colon, significantly lower (P < 0.05) counts of Enterococcus spp. and coliforms in colon, and significantly higher (P < 0.05) levels of butyrate and acetate in colonic digesta. In addition, rats taking infrared roasting (IR)-treated oat foods also demonstrated significantly higher (P < 0.05) fecal Lactobacillus spp. counts and significantly lower (P < 0.05) cecal and fecal counts of E. coli, Enterococcus spp. and coliforms than rats taking no oat foods. As for the comparison between the enzyme-undeactivated oat group and the three enzyme-deactivated oat groups, there were no significant differences in most of the parameters (P > 0.05), though a few exceptions did exist.

"Oats are a low input cereal widely grown across the world as both a grain and forage crop. Significant areas of production are in Northern Europe and North America and also in China and Australia. Although a traditional crop in many countries, in the last 50 years there has been a significant shift in oat production as a consequence of changing agricultural production and competition from other cereal crops. Oats are of significant economic importance for human consumption, for livestock feed and increasingly as a source of high value compounds with industrial applications as a consequence of the many unique properties of the oat grain. Traditional use in human diets in many countries has been boosted by the recent recognition of oats as a health food. This is attributed to the presence of beta-glucan, the major endospermic cell wall polysaccharide. As a result, there has been an increase in the use of oats and a broadening of oat based products. Increasing knowledge of the composition of the oat grain and its value for the various end-users is leading to new opportunities for the crop. While the value of oats as a break crop in cereal based rotations is widely recognised, maintaining the profitability of the crop whilst meeting the needs of end users is essential for future production. Opportunities exist for plant breeders and agronomists to introduce new oat varieties with tailored agronomic approaches to address this challenge and to ensure the sustainability of oats for the future.",579,99,99,1,1,1,3,0,0,2,248
"Methods: This study sought to evaluate the impact of oat beta-glucan on insulin resistance in mice fed on high-fat and high-fructose diet with fructose (10%, w/v) added in drinking water for 10 weeks. Results: The results showed that supplementation with oat beta-glucan could significantly reduce the insulin resistance both in low-dose (200 mg/kg(-1) body weight) and high-dose (500 mg/kg(-1) body weight) groups, but the high-dose group showed a more significant improvement in insulin resistance (P<0.01) compared with model control (MC) group along with significant improvement in hepatic glycogen level, oral glucose, and insulin tolerance. Moreover, hepatic glucokinase activity was markedly enhanced both in low-dose and high-dose groups compared with that of MC group (P<0.05).

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare and evaluate for quality characteristics and p-glucan analysis during different stages of the oat flour and/or oat bran based bread baking process. Design/methodology/approach - A 100 per cent wheat flour (WF) formulation was substituted with 30, 50 and 70 per cent oat flour (OF) or oat bran (OB) to improve its nutritional quality characteristics of bread. The flour blends were evaluated for quality characteristics (loaf volume, texture profile analysis) and p-glucan analysis during different stages of the bread baking process. Findings - A significant decrease in specific volume, number of cells and crumb brightness was observed with increasing WF substitution levels with OF or OB. The crumb hardness was observed to be negatively correlated with specific volume of OF (r = 0.90, p < 0.0001) and OB (r = 0.84, p < 0.0001) bread. The level of P-glucan was significantly reduced by 37.8 - 42.9 per cent in dough during 45 min fermentation time, which indicating the enzymatic action. The p-glucan content of OF and OB bread was found to increase from 0.13 g/100 g bread (db) (control) to 1.35 and 3.61g beta-glucan/100 g bread (db) for 70 per cent WF substitution with OF and OB, respectively. Results show that a bread of acceptable quality can be prepared by substituting WF by up to 50 per cent for OF and up to 30 per cent by OB. Practical implications - Replacing white bread with oat flour/bran containing beta-glucan facilitates human consumption of soluble dietary fibre. Originality/value - The paper provides a comparative evaluation of the oat flour and/or bran based bread and its critical factors influencing the level of p-glucan during baking process, which attributes to improve the nutritional quality.",581,99,99,1,1,1,3,0,0,2,290
"Oats are a good source of many vitamins and minerals, including compounds that collectively constitute vitamin E, the tocols. Tocols are comprised of two subgroups, tocopherols and tocotrienols. Due to their potent antioxidant properties, attention has been given to the health benefits of tocols in oats. However, little is known about developmental aspects of their accumulation. Moreover, aside from their role in protecting membranes from oxidative damage, their possible physiological roles in planta have largely gone uninvestigated. In this study, we quantified tocol accumulation at five time points during oat seed development, and also compared tocol concentration and composition in the whole seed both to endosperm and embryos at a late stage of seed development. The temporal pattern of accumulation of the tocol subgroups was different. Both tocotrienols and tocopherols steadily increased over the course of seed development; however, tocotrienol progression was sigmoidal and tocopherol linear. By the end of seed development, tocotrienols were the most abundant tocol both in whole seed and in seed with embryos removed. In contrast, embryos contained higher concentrations of tocopherols than tocotrienols late in seed development. Differences in both temporal and spatial distribution during seed development suggest distinct roles for tocotrienols and tocopherols. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",582,1,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,203
"Obesity accompanied with metabolic disorder is often complicated by hepatic regulations of lipid metabolism and lipoprotein recruitment. Recent reports have suggested that oat has metabolic-regulating effect. In this study, we examined whether oat could improve obesity, body fat, serum parameters and liver lipid metabolism. In high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed rats, oat effectively reduced body weight and fat, and decreased food efficiency but not appetite. Oat lowered serum glucose, free-fatty-acid (FFA), triacylglycerol (TG), cholesterol, and LDL-C/HDL-C elevated by HFD, and dose-dependently reduced hepatic TG and cholesterol. Thirty percent oat markedly reduced lipid synthesis biomarkers FAS, GPAT and HMG CoA reductase, while 15% and 30% oat stimulated expressions of oxidation markers PPAR alpha, CPT-1 and phosphorylated-AMPK. Oat increased LDL receptor, being beneficial for serum lipid-lowering. Thus, Oat could act as adjuvant therapeutics for metabolic disorders via attenuating obesity, body fat, and improving serum parameters with metabolic regulation and lipid clearance of liver.

"The antioxidant effects of sesamol films were evaluated using a food simulant (linoleic acid) and a real food (oat cereal). Sesamol was melt blended with high density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene and ethylene-vinyl acetate resins using co-extrusion to produce sesamol films of multilayer structure; for comparison, films containing butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) or no additive (as control) were also produced. At least 60% of the initial amount of sesamol remained in the films after extrusion. The release of sesamol from the sesamol films was about six times faster at 30 degrees C than at 10 degrees C. The antioxidant effectiveness of sesamol and BHT was evaluated on the basis of induction period of lipid oxidation, conjugated dienes (for linoleic acid), hexanal (for oat breakfast) and sensory evaluation. Compared with the control film, the sesamol films extended the induction period of linoleic acid by five and eight times at 40 degrees C and 23 degrees C, respectively. After 12month storage at 23 degrees C, hexanal formation was 59% less in cereal packaged with sesamol films than that packaged with control film. Rancid odours were detected in cereal packaged with control films, but not with sesamol or BHT films. The incorporation of sesamol had only slight effects on tensile properties and transparency.

"Health effects of beta-glucan are typically related to dose, size and viscosity without taking the specific molecular structure into account. High beta-glucan mutant barley, mother barley and oat beta-glucans were large-scale extracted by comparable protocols using hot water, enzyme assisted hydrolysis and ethanol precipitation leading to similar molecular masses (200-300 kDa). Multivariate data analysis on all compositional, structural and functional features demonstrated that the main variance among the samples was primarily explained by block structural differences as determined by HPSEC-PAD. In particular the barley high beta-glucan mutant proved to exhibit a unique block structure with DP3 and DP4 contributions of: 78.9% and 16.7% as compared to the barley mother (72.1% and 21.4%) and oat (66.1% and 29.1%). This unique block structure was further confirmed by the H-1 NMR determination of the beta-1,4 to beta-1,3 linkage ratio. Low solubility of the barley samples was potentially an effect of substructures consisting of longer repetitive cellotriosyl sequences. FT-Raman and NMR spectroscopy were useful in measuring sample impurities of alpha-glucans and prediction of beta-linkage characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Population studies show a positive association between increased dietary intake of wholegrains and reduced risk of cardiometabolic disorders. Consumption of wholegrain food has been associated with lower blood glucose and therefore may contribute to a low-glycaemic load diet. The ability to mediate a prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota has recently been suggested to have an inverse correlation with risk of cardiometabolic disease. To date very little work has been carried out on the functionality of wholegrain breakfast cereals in terms of glycaemic response or impact on gut microbiota. An investigation into identifying wholegrain-based breakfast cereals demonstrating both low glycaemic index (GI) and prebiotic attributes was performed. After in vitro digestion, cereal samples were supplemented to pH-controlled anaerobic batch cultures of the human faecal microbiota. Total bacteria populations increased significantly (P<0.05) in all treated cultures, and the fermentation of a wholegrain oat cluster cereal was associated with proliferation of the Bifidobacterium genus (P=0.02). Smaller, but significant increases in the Bifidobacterium genus were observed for a further four oat-based cereals. Significant increases in the Lactobacillus-Enterococcus group were observed for granola (P=0.01), 100% wholegrain aggregate (P=0.04) and 70% wholegrain loops (P=0.01). Cereals demonstrating prebiotic potential were selected for GI determination in twelve healthy subjects. The wholegrain oat aggregate cereal achieved the lowest GI value (40), three other cereals ranged between 44 and 74, with instant porridge resulting in a GI value similar to the standard glucose control. The present study suggests that wholegrain oat-based breakfast cereals may be prebiotics and have the potential to have low GI.",586,1,99,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,254
"Total folate content in oat varieties from three harvesting years (2006-2008), and in oats milling fractions, was determined using microbiological assay. Furthermore, folate vitamer distribution in milling fractions were examined with the UPLC method, which was taken in use and validated. The total folate content of the cultivars varied moderately within each year. The average content in the 2008 samples was 685 ng/g dm. The UPLC method proved fast and sensitive for determining seven folate monoglutamates in cereal samples. Folate content in fractions, which are normally discarded, such as flour from oat cutting and flaking, were 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher than in native grain. The main folate vitamers found in the oat fractions were 5-CH3-H(4)folate, 5-HCO-H(4)folate, and 5,10-CH+-H(4)folate. The UPLC results more closely matched the microbiological results compared to those that are usually achieved with HPLC methods. This study illustrates that oats and, especially, by-products of milling are good sources of folate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",587,99,1,99,1,1,3,0,0,2,159
"The primary objective was to determine the beneficial effects of oat beta-glucan (OG) and barley beta-glucan (BG) on gut health. A total of 200 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups Of 40 rats each, control group (CON), low-dose OG-administered group (OGL), high-dose OG-administered group (OGH), low-dose BG-administered group (BGL), and high-dose BC-administered group (BGH). OGL and OGH were administered oat beta-glucan by intragastric gavage at a dose, of 0.35 g/kg of body Weight (BW) and 0.70 g/kg of BW. daily for 6 weeks, and BGL and BGH Were administered barley beta-glucan. The CON received normal saline. Intestinal-health-related indexes were analyzed at baseline, week 3, week 6, and week 7. Cereal beta-glucan significantly influenced the fecal water content, pH value, ammonia levels, beta-glucuronidase activity, azoreductase activity, and colonic short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations (p < 0.05). Moreover, the population of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium increased (p < 0.05), whereas the number of Enterobacteriaceae decreased (p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner during the period of cereal beta-glucan administration. These results suggested that cereal beta-glucan might exert favorable effects on improving intestinal functions and health but the gut-health-promoting effects of oat beta-glucan were better than those of barley beta-glucan.",588,1,1,-1,1,1,4,1,0,0,198
"Oat (Avena sativa L.) is an important crop produced in various regions of Europe and North America. Oat lipids are a heterogeneous mixture of acyl lipids and unsaponifiable components the neutral lipids are mainly triacylglycerols and account for 50-60% of total oat lipids. Oat oil is also rich in polar lipid's, that is, phospholipids and glycolipids. Characterization of oat polar lipids has largely been performed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), but the composition of phospholipid classes has been poorly studied. The aim of our work was the determination of different phospholipids in Romanian oat samples. For that purpose, one commercial sample (Comun) and four pure varieties (Jeremy, Lovrin 1, Lovrin 27-T, and Mures) were used High-performance liquid chromatography combined with an evaporative light scattering detector results allowed us to establish that phosphatidylethanolamine was the most representative phospholipid in all Of the oat samples In addition, high-performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis showed that C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, C18:3, C20:0, and C20:1 Were the fatty acids bound to the glycerol backbone. Using first preparative TLC and later gas chromatography, it was demonstrated that linoleic acid (C18:2) was the main fatty acid of the phospholipid fraction in all of the samples.",589,1,99,0,1,99,2,0,1,2,204
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of rapid test kits for analysis of deoxynivalenol (DON), a mycotoxin commonly found in small-grain cereals. Concentrations of DON and its acetylated derivative 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) were analysed in naturally contaminated wheat (n=56) and oats (n=81) using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, i.e. Ridascreen (R) DON ('Standard ELISA') and Ridascreen (R) FAST DON ('Fast ELISA'), and two lateral flow devices, i.e. Rida (R) QUICK DON ('Quick LFD') and Rosa (R) DON (Rosa LFD'). Analysis by the LC-MS/MS reference method showed a median DON + 3-ADON concentration of 1,168 mu g/kg (90th percentile 3,264 mu g/kg) in wheat and 2,250 mu g/kg (90th percentile of 9,008 mu g/kg) in oats. Rosa LFD offered the best reliability, achieving detection that was stable across toxin levels in both matrices. In addition, Rosa LED had the highest accuracy (i.e. proportion of correct results) at a DON level of 1,250 mu g/kg in wheat (0.83) and 8,000 mu g/kg in oats (0.96). Standard ELISA achieved the highest accuracy at a DON level of 1,750 mu g/kg in oats (0.85). Detection by Quick LFD in wheat and Fast ELISA in both wheat and oats differed significantly among toxin levels (P <= 0.05), with recoveries outside European Union requirements (70-120%) in some cases. The correlation with results from LC-MS/MS analysis in oats was best for Rosa LFD (R-2=0.79). In wheat, however the correlation was best for Fast ELISA (R-2=0.81). Rosa LFD was regarded as well-suited for on-site detection. Standard ELISA allowed simultaneous testing of several samples and achieved detection that was stable across toxin levels in both matrices, making it a useful alternative in laboratories. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the performance of rapid test kits for detection of DON in naturally contaminated oats.",590,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,2,0,299
"Studies of a spectrum of metabolites found in cereals are becoming one of the primary tools for evaluating their susceptibility to the effects of various environmental agents, such as: pathogens, temperature and precipitation. In order to reduce the effect of the environmental conditions, cultivars were grown under identical cultivation conditions. This study aimed to construct a model to differentiate infected from non-infected cereals by developing the metabolomic profile of barley, oats and rye. Fungal and total microflora content, trichothecenes, fatty acids and volatile compounds were determined in the grains using GC/MS and en electronic nose. The most significant compounds in the construction of the model were established as the following volatiles: (E, E)-3,5 octadien 2-one, 1-heptanol, naphthalene, p-xylene and dimethyl sulphone; fatty acids: oleic acid (C18:1n-9), alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) and palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7); mycotoxins: T-2, and HT-2 toxins and deoxynivalenol as well as the terpene: trichodiene. Chemometric techniques were established to enable the identification of the grains. Results indicate the necessity to extend the scope of analyses of cereals to include the metabolomic aspect. This will make it possible to identify a dependence between their most significant traits and will contribute to a better understanding of their cereal resistance mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of dietary fibre addition to partially baked and frozen wheat rolls on the glycaemic index (GI). Healthy humans volunteers (n = 15) took part in the study. They were asked to attend six times in the early morning, over three weeks. Each tested four types of wheat rolls - two without dietary fibre addition: (1) fully baked, non-frozen (FBNF), (2) partially baked and frozen (PBF); and two with the addition of 10% dietary fibre: (3) fully baked, non-frozen (FBNF + F). (4) partially baked and frozen (PBF + F). Glucose solution was used as a reference food and tested twice. Blood glucose concentrations were measured before consumption, as well as at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the start of the meal. Dietary fibre consisted of oat fibre (75%) and of inulin (25%). It was concluded that both factors (freezing and fibre), applied to the wheat rolls at the same time, reduced statistically significantly (P <= 0.05) the glycaemic index by 34% - PBF + F (GI = 53 +/- 7) compared to control - FBNF roll (GI = 87 +/- 11).

"Breadmaking achievement using grains alternative to wheat and rye is a challenging task for cereal technologists, since most of the available innovative breads are characterised by poor crumb and crust characteristics, slight flavour and fast staling. To improve texture, mouth-feel, acceptability and shelf-life of breads prepared by using minor and/or under-utilised cereals, gluten and/or polymeric substances that mimic the viscoelastic properties of gluten, are required. Recent studies reported that high hydrostatic pressure (HP) treatment may represent an efficient non-thermal technique to promote the dough structure formation of composite cereal matrices. In the present study the effects of HP on the techno-functional and nutritional properties of oat-, millet-, and sorghum- based breads were evaluated compared to their unpressured- and gluten-added conventionally made counterparts. HP-treated (350 MPa, 10 min) wheat, oat, millet and sorghum batters were added to the bread recipe, replacing 50%, 60% and 40% of untreated wheat flour, respectively. Data from bread analyses revealed non significant physico-chemical impairment, and superior nutritional and sensory profiles in most quality features when HP treatment was applied to dough batters, compared with conventional/gluten-added samples. Specifically. HP breads deserved better sensory scores and exhibited higher antiradical activities despite a reduction in specific volume (wheat and oat) and faster staling kinetics (millet and sorghum) that were explicit in some composite samples.

"Oat malt is a nutritionally rich ingredient mainly used in a small number of speciality products. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of oat malt in wheat baking. The effect of oat malt on bread and dough properties at levels ranging from 0.5% to 5% was studied and compared with barley and wheat malts. The addition of all malts increased loaf specific volumes. Barley and wheat malts at levels above 2.5% led to a sticky and coarse crumb, but the effect of oat malt on the crumb grain was negligible. Rheological characterisation could not explain the superior baking performance of oat malt, as it increased extensibility and decreased resistance extensively indicating weakening of the extensional properties of the gluten network. The high lipolytic activity may have compensated for the loss of dough strength by improving the surface properties of gas cells. The results show that oat malt can be used in wheat baking to improve the loaf volume and nutritional quality without the detrimental effects associated with the excess amylolytic activity of barley and wheat malts.

"Coeliac disease is a permanent inflammatory disorder of the small bowel affecting approximately 1% of the population. The only effective treatment that exists is exclusion of gluten from the diet. The present paper aims to review the literature as to whether oats are safe to eat for people with coeliac disease. Much data exist on the restrictive nature that adhering to a gluten-free diet imposes on an individual. If oats could be eaten, this would help reduce the restrictive nature of the diet. This in turn could lead to an increase in the quality of life. Oats are of high-nutritional value, providing a rich source of fibre, vitamins and minerals. The fibre source contains soluble fibre which is believed to help reduce LDL-cholesterol. A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Earlier studies conducted are difficult to compare as they used different methodologies and it is not known whether samples of oats in the studies were contaminated with gluten from other cereals. Many studies reviewed do not state the strain of oat used. Recent research has suggested that it may only be in certain strains of oats which could produce a toxic response to people with coeliac disease. In conclusion, research suggests that the risk from consuming oats may be less harmful than first thought; however, may vary according to the strain of oat. Handling that risk in clinical practice remains controversial.",595,1,-1,0,1,0,2,1,2,0,232
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the survival of Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 in creams, prepared with pigeon peas and oat.

Viable numbers of L. reuteri and pH were determined after 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in protein, fat, fibre and carbohydrate content between creams. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found on sensory quality between control and creams with L. reuteri. After 28 days, the cell viability was above 7 log cfu/g in all creams. L. reuteri ATCC 55730 had the highest viability in cream with 40% pigeon pea and 20% oat (8.16 log cfu/g).

"Due to increased awareness of consumers about the relationship between food and health as well as the requirements of people following a gluten-free diet, the production of cereal products from raw materials other than wheat is of interest. However, the elimination of the visco-elastic gluten protein represents a technological challenge. During this study, response surface methodology was applied to determine optimal formulations for the production of egg pasta from oat and teff flour. Wheat flour was used as a control. The resulting products were characterised regarding firmness and elasticity, stickiness and cooking loss. The results showed that the mechanical texture of oat and teff pasta was comparable to wheat pasta, however, elasticity was significantly reduced. Compositional analysis was carried out on flour raw materials as well as on the final pasta products, showing that regarding fibre and mineral content, oat and teff samples are nutritionally superior to wheat. In addition, the microstructure was investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy, allowing also the observation of structural changes occurring during cooking. Upon cooking, a distinct outer layer can be observed, resulting from protein denaturation and starch gelatinisation. This structural feature is clearly visible for cooked wheat pasta and but is less apparent for teff and oat pasta.",597,99,99,1,0,99,1,0,1,3,206
"Dietary oat or oat products may potentially help to fight against high risk of cardiovascular diseases and beta-glucan in oat was considered as a central player. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary oat whole meal or beta-glucan on insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism of rats. Rats were fed with control diet, oat whole meal based diet, or control diet with supplemented beta-glucan for 4 weeks. Oat whole meal and beta-glucan increased insulin sensitivity index. Interestingly, supplementation of oat whole meal or beta-glucan induced increases in intestinal Na+K+-ATPase activity, Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase activity, and energy charge, particularly in the distal part of small intestine (ileum). Furthermore, amounts of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in colon contents were elevated by oat whole meal or beta-glucan.

"Oats have received attention because of their nutritional characteristics, especially their high-quality content of beta-glucan. The drying process reduces water content; therefore they can be preserved for long periods. However, high-temperature drying process may affect the physical, chemical, and functional properties of the grains. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different drying temperatures on beta-glucan quality in oat grains. Grains of oats (Avena sativa, L.), cultivar Albasul, harvested at harvest moisture content of 23% were submitted to stationary drying at air temperatures of 25, 50, 75, and 100 degrees C until they reached 13% moisture content. The beta-glucan content was determined in samples of oat grains and extraction was performed using water as solvent at 90 degrees C. The beta-glucan extract was evaluated for water holding capacity, water retention capacity, capacity of displacement, and gelation properties. Stationary of oat grains at air temperatures above 25 degrees C decreased the water holding capacity, whereas the content of beta-glucan and the water retention capacity of beta-glucan extract was affected at temperatures above 50 degrees C. Physical changes such as increased gelation capacity of the beta-glucan extract occurred following drying at air temperature over 75 degrees C.",599,0,99,0,99,1,1,0,2,2,199
"Two different headspace sampling techniques were compared for analysis of aroma volatiles from freshly produced and aged plain oatcakes. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) using a Carboxen-Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibre and entrainment on Tenax TA within an adsorbent tube were used for collection of volatiles. The effects of variation in the sampling method were also considered using SPME. The data obtained using both techniques were processed by multivariate statistical analysis (PCA). Both techniques showed similar capacities to discriminate between the samples at different ages. Discrimination between fresh and rancid samples could be made on the basis of changes in the relative abundances of 14-15 of the constituents in the volatile profiles.

"Oatmeal, an alternative, renewable, and low-cost substrate, was used for the production of Trichoderma viride spores by submerged fermentation. The nonconventional oat medium was only supplemented with potato peptone, which is a green source of nitrogen for the microorganism. Because particles are suspended in the nonconventional oat medium, the characterization was based on viscosity, average particle diameter, size distribution, and porosity of the particles. Because of the complexity of the fungal biomass extraction, the dry weight and protein content were used as methods for quantifying the growth of T. viride. The inversion between the proportion of mycelia and spores was captured in the microscopic image analysis during the fermentation process. After 60 h, spores began to appear, accounting for most of the form present at 120 h of fermentation. The decrease in pH and the increase in glucose concentration during fermentation indicate that glucan hydrolysis occurs and that glucose is released into the medium. The potential for industrial applications of submerged fermentation with oats for biomass production of T. viride is noted in the results. This simple and easily controllable process has several advantages, including the use of low-cost substrates for the propagation of a microorganism that is widely used in scientific and commercial settings.

"Extraction protocols for beta-glucan from oat flour were tested to determine optimal conditions for beta-glucan quality testing, which included extractability and molecular weight. We found mass yields of beta-glucan were constant at all temperatures, pH values, and flour-to-water ratios, as long as sufficient time and enough repeat extractions were performed and no hydrolytic enzymes were present. Extracts contained about 30-60% beta-glucan, with lower proportions associated with higher extraction temperatures in which more starch and protein were extracted. All commercial starch hydrolytic enzymes tested, even those that are considered homogenous, degraded beta-glucan apparent molecular weight as evaluated by size-exclusion chromatography. Higher concentration beta-glucan solutions could be prepared by controlling the flour-to-water ratio in extractions. Eight grams of flour per 50 mL of water generated the highest native beta-glucan concentrations. Routine extractions contained 2 g of enzyme-inactivated flour in 50 mL of water with 5mM sodium azide (as an antimicrobial), which were stirred overnight, centrifuged, and the supernatant boiled for 10 min. The polymer extracted had a molecular weight of about 2 million and was stable at room temperature for at least a month.",602,99,0,1,1,1,3,0,1,1,182
"Effects of genotype and environment on (1 -> 3),(1 -> 4)-beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan) extractability, flour slurry viscosity, and beta-glucan polymer fine structure in oats were tested. One environment had a severe negative effect on slurry viscosity as evaluated with a rotational viscometer. Environment also had a strong effect on beta-glucan extractability, whereas genotype had no significant effect. Fine structure of beta-glucan was evaluated from the frequencies of oligosaccharides from lichenase hydrolysis of the beta-glucan polymer. Significant differences in degree of polymerization (DP) fragment frequencies were found associated with both genotype and growth environment. The high-beta-glucan cultivar HiFi had lower DP3 fragment frequency and higher frequencies of DP4 and DP6 fragments than other cultivars with moderate beta-glucan concentration. Drier environments tended to yield lower DP3 fragment frequencies as well. Drier environments and genotypes with more beta-glucan synthetic potential may have provided cellular environments with more competition for substrate for beta-glucan synthesis, which appeared associated with lower DP3 fragment frequency. In a separate experiment, we found that extractable beta-glucan had higher frequencies of DP3 fragments and lower frequency of DP4 fragments. The observed variations deserve consideration for influence on functional properties, such as viscosity or health benefit potential.",603,99,0,99,0,0,0,0,3,2,195
"Oat beta-glucan enriched extruded cereals with molecular weights (MWs) ranging from 2,180,000 to 326,000 were produced. Test meals composed of 31 g of available carbohydrate, 8.3-8.7 grams of beta-glucan, and milk were administered to subjects and their postprandial blood glucose levels monitored for 2 hr. White bread plus milk and a control wheat bran cereal plus milk were administered, and white bread alone served as a reference food for estimation of glycemic index (GI) of the cereals, after adjusting for the effect of adding milk to white bread. Both oat bran and wheat bran cereals significantly reduced peak blood glucose rise (PBGR) and area under the curve (AUC) versus white bread alone or white bread plus milk. There was a significant inverse relationship between AUC and log(10)[ weight average MW] (r(2) = 0.96, P = 0.0192). There was a significant inverse relationship between PBGR and log(10)[ viscosity] of in vitro extracts from all cereals, including the wheat control (r(2) = 0.96, P = 0.0031). However, no significant differences in glycemic responses among the oat bran cereals were found with pairwise comparisons.

"Oat seeds have an oil content of up to 13 %, of which up to 34 % can be polar lipids (glycolipids and phospholipids). Because of their amphiphilic structure, these polar lipids are potential emulsifiers. In this study, polar lipid fraction from oat produced by a supercritical fluid extraction process was fractionated into different polar lipid classes by HPLC and the lipid classes in subfractions were identified by comparing retention times with reference compounds and performing co-injections. The oat polar lipid fraction contained monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, steryl glycoside, and phosphatidyl choline, and also possibly phosphatidyl inositol. The polar lipid fraction was also used as an emulsifier to produce oil-in-water emulsions with different amounts of emulsifier and oil, and the stability and other properties of emulsions were studied. Emulsions were formed quite easily, but they were prone to rapid creaming even after a couple of days of storage at ambient conditions. Droplet size and droplet size distribution of the emulsions seemed to be slightly smaller with smaller amount of oil and larger amount of emulsifier. Generally, the droplet size of the emulsions was in the range of 0.2-4 mu m, and with the largest amount of oil (5 %, w/v) up to 10 mu m. The upper phase of creamed emulsions contained slightly larger droplets, up to 30 mu m, while the lower phase retained smaller droplets. Microscopic investigation revealed that the increase in droplet size of the upper phase was mainly due to aggregation, which implies that these emulsions may be stable against coalescence to some extent.",605,99,99,99,0,99,0,0,1,4,256
"Rye bran and aleurone, wheat bran and aleurone, and oat bran and cell wall concentrate were compared in their in vitro gut fermentation patterns of individual phenolic acids and short-chain fatty acids, preceded by enzymatic in vitro digestion mimicking small intestinal events. The formation of phenolic metabolites was the most pronounced from the wheat aleurone fraction. Phenylpropionic acids, presumably derived from ferulic acid (FA), were the major phenyl metabolites formed from all bran preparations. The processed rye, wheat, and oat bran fractions contained more water-extractable dietary fiber (DF) and had smaller particle sizes and were thus more easily fermentable than the corresponding brans. Rye aleurone and bran had the highest fermentation rate and extent probably due to high fructan and water-extractable arabinoxylan content. Oat samples also had a high content of water-extractable DF, beta-glucan, but their fermentation rate was lower. Enzymatic digestion prior to in vitro colon fermentation changed the structure of oat cell walls as visualized by microscopy and increased the particle size, which is suggested to have retarded the fermentability of oat samples. Wheat bran was the most slowly fermentable among the studied samples, presumably due to the high proportion of water-unextractable DF. The in vitro digestion reduced the fructan content of wheat samples, thus also decreasing their fermentability. Among the studied short-chain fatty acids, acetate dominated the profiles. The highest and lowest production of propionate was from the oat and wheat samples, respectively. Interestingly, wheat aleurone generated similar amounts of butyrate as the rye fractions even without rapid gas production.",606,0,0,1,1,99,2,0,2,1,253
"Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in China and worldwide. Whole grain oats can reduce risk of CVD by reducing total and LDL-cholesterol, major risk factors for CVD. While this association has been established in many populations, data from Asian populations is limited. Thus, this study investigated the impact of oat consumption on cholesterol levels in Chinese adults. Male and female data from this work were previously published separately in mandarin in two Chinese journals. The combined male and female data were reanalyzed and are presented here. Methods: A randomized, controlled, parallel-arm study was conducted at Beijing Hospital, Beijing china. Subjects were adults (men and women) with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia. The oat group (n=85) consumed 100grams of instant oat cereal versus the control group (n=81) who consumed 100grams of wheat flour-based noodles daily for 6weeks. Laboratory and anthropometric measurements were conducted at baseline and at the end of the 6-week intervention. Results: Dietary fiber intake increased significantly in the oat group compared to the control group at the end of the 6-week intervention. Total-, LDL-cholesterol and waist circumference decreased significantly in the oat group compared to the control. HDL-cholesterol decreased significantly in the control group versus the oat group. There were no significant changes in blood pressure, other anthropometric or laboratory measures between the two groups at the end of the intervention. Conclusions: Instant oatmeal consumed daily for 6 weeks significantly increased fiber intake and decreased major risk factors for CVD in Chinese adults with hypercholesterolemia. Increased consumption of whole grains, including oats, should continue to be encouraged.",607,1,1,1,99,0,3,0,1,1,263
"Effect of oat beta-glucan on the fermentation of set-style yogurt was investigated by incorporating 0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.5% of purified oat beta-glucan into the yogurt mix. It was found that levels up to 0.3% resulted in yogurts with quality characteristics similar to the control yogurt. Higher levels of beta-glucan however retarded the fermentation process with noticeable difference in the characteristics of the yogurt. Examination of the morphologies of yogurt with and without beta-glucan revealed that beta-glucan formed aggregates with casein micelle and did not form phase-separated domains. This research demonstrated that beta-glucan could be added to yogurt up to 0.3%, which meets the nutrient guidelines, to have added nutritional benefits. Practical Application: Yogurt is known for its beneficial effects on human health and nutrition. Yogurt production and consumption is increasing in the United States every year. However, it is lacking in beta-glucans, which are recognized for their nutritional importance as functional bioactive ingredients. The main objective was to develop and characterize low-fat yogurts with added beta-glucan. This research demonstrated that beta-glucan could be added to yogurt up to 0.3%, which meets the nutrient guidelines for added nutritional benefits, without affecting the characteristics of yogurt significantly. This study will benefit the dairy industry by generating new products offering healthy alternatives.",608,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,212
"BACKGROUND: The effect of functional foods alone or in combination (cocoa + soy + oats + fish oil) on hepatic damage in rats affected with metabolic syndrome was investigated. RESULTS: Rats that were given cocoa showed a decrease in the levels of triglycerides (TGs) and glucose (63 and 32% respectively) as well as a decrease in blood pressure (15%). Animals fed with soy showed a reduction of 21% in total cholesterol, 15% in blood pressure and 44% in TGs, while feeding oats reduced the concentration of TGs by 53% (P < 0.5). Fish oil caused a reduction in TGs (56%) and glucose (26%). The effect on blood pressure was statistically significant for the groups supplemented with cocoa, soy, cocoa + oats and the total mix. The main finding was a reduction in liver steatosis in animals supplemented with cocoa + oats (from 30 to 4.7% steatosis). Cocoa or fish oil alone did not protect the liver from damage, while cocoa + fish oil did. CONCLUSION: The most relevant effects were that the cocoa + oats mix decreased steatosis by a very large percentage, as did the cocoa + fish oil mix and the mix of all four functional foods.

"The purpose of the present work is to study the pancreatic lipase inhibitory effects of different subfractions (n-hexane, ethyl acetate (EA), n-butanol, and water) from ethanol extracts of nonfermented and fungi fermented oats and to delineate the interactions of three primary phenolic acids in the EA subfractions. The EA subfraction showed the highest inhibitory effect on pancreatic lipase activity at 1.5 mg/mL compared to the other subfractions, regardless of whether the oats were fermented. Meanwhile, both of the EA subfractions of two fungi fermented oats demonstrated more effective inhibitory activity than that of nonfermented oats. A positive correlation between the total phenolics content and inhibitory activity was. found. The inhibitory ability of the EA subfraction from nonfermented or fermented oats also displayed a dose dependent effect The standards of caffeic, ferulic, and p-coumaric acids, mainly included in EA subfractions of fermented oats, also displayed a dose dependent inhibitory effect A synergistic effect of each binary combination of p-coumaric, ferulic, and caffeic acids was observed, especially at 150.0 mu g/mL. Those results indicate that fungi fermented oats have a more effective inhibitory ability on pancreatic lipase and polyphenols may be the most effective component and could be potentially used for dietary therapy of obesity.",610,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,203
"Our research has been aimed at an evaluation of the influence of seed health conditions on biological characteristics of seeds and a following seed generation (it was demonstrated on a model crop - oat). Exact small-plot trials were established on three different experimental certified organic parcels in the Czech Republic between 2010 and 2011. Two varieties of hulled oat and two varieties of naked oat were used. A rate of grain contamination with microscopic fungi was studied and assessed before seeding and after harvest of the seeds. A method of isolation of micromycets on cultivation media was applied in order to assess the contamination rate. As for the biological characteristics, energy of germination, germination, energy of emergence and emergence were studied and evaluated in the framework of the research. The results showed that the seed origin has no influence neither on the health conditions of the emerged plants nor on the rate of the microscopic fungi contamination of the following seed generation. The hulled oat caryopses were more seriously affected by Fusarium spp., Alternaria spp. and Penicillium spp. Such a less serious affection of the naked oat caryopses might be explained by a harvest of the caryopses rid of hulls, which are inclined more often to contamination with pathogens. The influence of the seed health conditions on the seed's biological characteristics has not been proved via correlation analysis. However, Penicillium spp. usually contributes to a reduction of the germination ability. Farm saved seeds might be recommended to farmers in case of a deficiency of certified organic seeds and a ban of application of conventional untreated seeds. However, the use of farm saved seeds has to be done carefully and meet strict requirements.",611,0,99,99,99,99,0,0,1,4,282
"Aroma constituents of crude and roasted oat, which has a characteristic aroma, were extracted by means of solvent extraction. Soxhlet extraction and simultaneous distillation extraction method and analyzed by means of GC-MS. It was optimistic method that simultaneous distillation extraction. Total of 96 and 158 compounds were identified by GC-MS in the volatile fraction of raw and heated oat, respectively. In the aromatic fraction of raw oat 33 alcohols, 29 esters, 15 aldehydes, 6 ketones, 12 acids and 1 amine compound were found. In heated oat 12 alcohols, 23 esters, 30 aldehydes, 21 ketones, 10 acids, 5 furan, 1 sulfur compound, 12 amine, 8 phenols, 5 furans, 20 pyrazines, 3 pyrimidines, 1 pyridine, 1 nitrile, I hydrazine, 2 ethers, 1 thiazole, 2 thiophenes, 4 benzpyrroles and 1 pyrrole were identified as constituents of the aroma profile of baked oat.

"The effects of different inactivating treatments including hot air roasting, normal-pressure steaming, high-pressure steaming, infrared roasting, and microwave heating on the storage properties and flavor quality of oats were studied. These methods significantly inactivated the lipase of oats, even if using infrared roasting treatment had a worse inhibition effect of hydrolysis. As a result, the storage properties of oats were improved with different inactivating treatments, except infrared roasting. PCA analysis showed that all the oat flours could be clearly discriminated by the electronic nose. Sensory evaluation showed that the qualities of oat flour were hot air roasting (7.25), infrared toasting (7.17), microwave heating (5.92), high-pressure steaming (5.85), and normal-pressure steaming (5.57). It was concluded that there was a significant relationship between inactivation treatment and oat flavor. That is to say dry heating resulted in more favorable sensory quality of oat flour.",613,0,0,99,99,1,1,0,2,2,141
"Oat and oat products containing beta-glucans are associated with many health claims. Both the level and molecular weight of beta-glucans play an important role in determining the physiological efficacy of beta-glucan in terms of health benefits, including reducing blood cholesterol levels. The objective of this study was to develop a probabilistic model to investigate the effect of various process stages in bread making on the level of beta-glucan (BG) and its molecular weight (Mw) distribution using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Various composite flours were formulated by substituting wheat flour (WF) with oat whole flour (OWF), oat refined flour (ORF), oat bran (OB) or rolled oats (RO). The baseline model predicted an overall mean reduction of 49% in BG in baked bread. The mean Mw of beta-glucan in all composite flours was reduced following processing and baking from 1.22 to 0.77 x 10(6) (g/mol) for OWF + WF, 1.07 to 0.68 x 10(6) (g/mol) for ORF + WF, 1.17 to 0.75 x 10(6) (g/mol) for OB + WF and 1.25 to 0.80 x 10(6) (g/mol) for RO + WF. In all formulated breads, high molecular weight beta-glucan was observed to be more susceptible to degradation compared with medium molecular weight and to lower molecular weight. A sensitivity analysis highlighted the negative influence of WF on beta-glucan content and the BG reduction with fermentation time. The scenario analysis showed a positive influence on the level of BG with increase addition of oat flour in all formulated breads. The model was validated with experimental data and values were found to be within the confidence interval of predicted BG levels. This model facilitates the optimisation of various steps in the bread making process and highlights the potential for oat flour to improve the nutritional quality of baked bread.",614,1,-1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,294
"The objective of this study was to develop a beta-glucan human exposure assessment model for a barley and a oat based bread and to compare the resulting exposure to the current FDA recommendation for a health promoting effect (3 g beta-glucan/day, 0.75 g/portion of beta-glucan). Three formulated barley and oat based breads with 30% (S1), 50% (S2) and 70% (S3) substitution of wheat flour were used in the Monte Carlo simulation model to predict human consumption levels. The level of soluble beta-glucan was found to reach 0.77 g/portion for some barley and oat based breads with a substitution level of S3. Under normal consumption patterns, consumption of barley based bread can meet up to 50% of the FDA recommended intake with Si, 70% with S2, and 100% with S3, whereas by consuming an oat based bread the FDA recommended intake is met 30% with Si, 50% with S2 and 70% with S3. The model predicted that total cholesterol (TC) lowered with an increase intake of beta-glucan content from -0.27 to -0.30 mmol/l and -0.18 to -0.29 mmol/l from S1 to S3 for barley and oats based bread, respectively. No significant change was noted for the blood glucose level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",615,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,4,0,205
"The aim of this study was to improve the bioavailability of the dietary phenolic acids in flours from whole grain barley and oat groat following fermentation with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibiting high feruloyl esterase activity (FAE). The highest increase of free phenolic acids was observed after fermentation with three probiotic strains, Lactobacillus Johnsonii LA1, Lactobacillus reuteri SD2112, and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, with maximum increases from 2.55 to 69.91 mu g g(-1) DM and from 4.13 to 109.42 mu g g(-1) DM in whole grain barley and oat groat, respectively. Interestingly, higher amounts of bound phenolic acids were detected after both water treatment and LAB fermentation in whole grain barley, indicating higher bioaccessibility, whereas some decrease was detected in oat groat. To conclude, cereal fermentation with specific probiotic strains can lead to significant increase of free phenolic acids, thereby improving their bioavailability.",616,1,1,99,1,1,4,0,0,1,142
"(7.45% beta-glucan) was mixed with water and heated to make oat slurry. Heated oat slurries were treated with a-amylase, lichenase, and/or proteinase to remove starch, beta-glucan, and/or protein. Oat slurries treated with lichenase or lichenase combined with alpha-amylase and/or proteinase reduced the molecular weight of beta-glucan. Heat and enzymatic treatment of oat slurries reduced the peak and final viscosities compared with the control. The control bound the least amount of bile acids (p < 0.05); heating of oat flour improved the binding. Heated oat slurries treated with lichenase or lichenase combined with alpha-amylase and/or proteinase bound the least amount of bile acid, indicating the contribution of beta-glucan to binding. Oat slurries treated with proteinase or proteinase and alpha-amylase together improved the bile acid binding, indicating the possible contribution of protein to binding. These results illustrate that beta-glucan was the major contributor to viscosity and in vitro bile acid binding in heated oat slurries; however, interactions with other components, such as protein and starch, indicate the importance of evaluating oat components as whole system.",617,99,0,99,99,0,0,0,2,3,173
"Polyphenol-polysaccharide interaction attracted much attention due to its crucial impact on the functional and sensory quality of foods. Monomers of tea polyphenols (TP) were selectively adsorbed by oat beta-glucan and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was the mostly adsorbed one in terms of adsorption capacity (q(e)) and efficiency (E-e) determined by equilibrium dialysis. Contrast to Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson models, Toth model fit best to the adsorption isotherm of EGCG. The adsorbing variables were optimised using response surface methodology. Linear variables of pH and temperature (T), interactive terms of EGCG concentration (C-EGCG)/buffer concentration (C-PBS) and pH/T and all quadratic variables of C-EGCG(2), pH(2), C-PBS(2) and T-2 made significant senses on q(e). The highest q(e) could be achieved with the following conditions: C-EGCG 0.7 mg/mL, pH 5.80, C-PBS 0.10 M and T50 degrees C. The consistency of the experimental (321.51 mu g/mg) and predicted (333.3 mu g/mg) values in q(e) confirmed the adequacy of the response surface equations.

"The effect of different levels of wheat, corn, rice and oat bran on the rheological and sensory characteristics of pide (Turkish flat bread) made with blends of some cereal brans with wheat flour was studied. Cereal brans were replaced with wheat flour at 0, 10, 15 and 20% levels. Farinogram properties of mixtures were determined. Pide samples were tested for crustcrumb color and sensory properties. Usage of different brans and ratios significantly affected farinograph properties. In general, pide samples supplemented with bran had lower L* values and higher a* and b* values. Detrimental effects of cereal brans were nearly the same. However, the fiber-rich pides were also considered acceptable by the sensory panel. There was a clear relationship between the average sensory scores and different cereal brans with different usage ratios. Results show that cereal branswheat flour blends can be successfully used for the production of pide. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Dietary fibers have become of interest in recent years because of its known physiological and metabolical effects. Brans of cereals have been used mainly as source of dietary fiber in cereal foods. Nowadays, concern has been thickened in the production of high-fiber ethnic foods. Published reports on using of dietary fibers in flat breads are limited.",619,0,99,1,-1,1,2,1,1,1,205
"Wheat bran (WB) and oat bran (OB), which are rich in dietary fiber content, were blended separately with wheat flour at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20%. The incorporation of WB and OB increased the farinograph water absorption from 58.3 to 64.1 and 62.3%, respectively. The dough stability decreased from 10 to 5.5 and 7.0 min. The increase in maximum pressure value was greater upon the addition of WB. The peak viscosity value decreased from 818 to 673 Brabender units (BU) upon the addition of WB. The addition of either WB or OB in the preparation of instant vermicelli made the strands tough. The moisture content and oil uptake decreased from 6.5 to 5.1% and from 18.3 to 16.6%, respectively. The cooked weight decreased, while the cooking loss increased with increasing levels of either of the bran. Combination of WB (5%) and OB (1015%) resulted in instant vermicelli of acceptable quality having total dietary fiber content of 6.12%. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS High-fiber ingredients exhibit many properties that influence the physiological functions of foods. Consumption of high-fiber products has shown several health benefits. There is a need to have products enriched with dietary fiber. Wheat bran and oat bran, which are good sources of insoluble and soluble dietary fiber, respectively, have been used in the preparation of various bakery products. The utilization of such sources has also helped in reducing the oil uptake during processing. This study would surely help the industry in developing fiber-rich instant vermicelli using the naturally available fiber-rich sources.",620,1,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,251
"The in vitro starch digestion rate and estimated glycemic index (GI) of oat flours and oat starches from typical and high beta-glucan oat lines were evaluated along with the impact of heating on starch digestion. Flour from oat lines ('Jim', 'Paul', IA95, and N979 containing 4.0, 5.3, 7.4, and 7.7% beta-glucan, respectively) was digested by pepsin and porcine pancreatin. To determine the impact of heating on starch digestion, oat slurries were prepared by mixing oat flour and water (1:8 ratio) and heating for 10 mm prior to digestion. Viscosity, as measured on a Rapid Visco Analyzer, increased with increases in concentration and molecular weight of beta-glucan. The in vitro starch digestion of oat flours and a control, white bread made from wheat flour, increased as the digestion time increased. Starch digestion of oat flour was slower than that of the control (p < 0.05). Heat treatment of oat-flour slurries increased the starch digestion from a range of 31-39% to a range of 52-64% measured after 180 min of in vitro digestion. There were no differences in starch digestibility among oat starches extracted from the different oat lines. The GI, estimated by starch hydrolysis of oat flours, ranged from 61 to 67, which increased to a range of 77-86 after heating. Oat-flour slurries prepared from IA95 and N979 lines with high beta-glucan concentrations had lower GI values than did slurries made from Jim and Paul lines. Starch digestion was negatively correlated with beta-glucan concentrations in heated oat-flour slurries (R-2 = 0.92). These results illustrate that the oat soluble fiber, beta-glucan, slowed the rate of starch digestion. This finding will help to develop new food products with low GI by using oat beta-glucan.",621,1,1,99,99,1,3,0,0,2,281
"High levels of Fusarium mycotoxins HT-2 and T-2 have been detected in UK oats since surveys started in 2002. Fusarium langsethiae and the closely related species F. sporotrichioides have previously been associated with the contamination of cereals with type A trichothecenes HT-2 and T-2 in Nordic countries. Preliminary microbiological analysis of UK oat samples with high concentrations of HT-2 and T-2 detected and isolated F. langsethiae and F. poae but not the other type A trichothecene producing species F. sporotrichioides, F. sibiricum and F. armeniacum. Two hundred and forty oat flour samples with a known mycotoxin profile were selected from a previous four year study (2002-2005) to cover the full concentration range from below the limit of quantification (<20 mu g/kg) to 9990 mu g/kg HT-2 + T-2 combined. All samples were analysed for the DNA of F. langsethiae, F. poae and F. sporotrichioides based on previously published PCR assays. F. langsethiae was detectable in nearly all samples; F. poae was detected in 90% of samples whereas F. sporotrichioides was not detected in any sample. A real-time PCR assay was developed to quantify F. langsethiae DNA in plant material. The assay could quantify as low as 10(-4) ng F. langsethiae DNA/mu l. Based on this assay and a previously published assay for F. poae, both species were quantified in the oat flour samples with known HT-2 + T-2 content. Results showed a good regression (P<0.001. r(2) = 0.60) between F. langsethiae DNA and HT-2 + T-2 concentration. F. poae DNA concentration was not correlated to HT2 + T2 concentration (P = 0.948) but was weakly correlated to nivalenol concentration (P<0.001, r(2) = 0.09). Multiple regression with F. langsethiae and F. poae DNA as explanatory variates identified that both F. langsethiae and F. poae DNA were highly significant (P<0.001) but F. poae DNA only accounted for an additional 4% of the variance and the estimate was negative, indicating that higher concentrations of F. poae DNA were correlated with slightly lower concent",622,99,1,0,-1,99,1,1,1,2,330
"Background and aim: Preliminary evaluation of a wild green oat extract (WGOE) (Neuravena(R) ELFA(R)955, Frutarom, Switzerland) revealed an acute cognitive benefit of supplementation. This study investigated whether regular daily WGOE supplementation would result in sustained cognitive improvements. Method: A 12-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of WGOE supplementation (1500 mg/day) versus placebo was undertaken in 37 healthy adults aged 67 +/- 0.8 years (mean +/- SEM). Cognitive assessments included the Stroop colour-word test, letter cancellation, the rule-shift task, a computerised multi-tasking test battery and the trail-making task. All assessments were conducted in Week 12 and repeated in Week 24 whilst subjects were fasted and at least 18 h after taking the last dose of supplement. Result: Chronic WGOE supplementation did not affect any measures of cognition. Conclusion: It appears that the cognitive benefit of acute WGOE supplementation does not persist with chronic treatment in older adults with normal cognition. It remains to be seen whether sustained effects of WGOE supplementation may be more evident in those with mild cognitive impairment.",623,0,1,-1,1,0,2,1,2,0,170
"Aqueous solutions of medium oat bran flour were treated with four carbohydrases viscozyme, celluclast, alpha-amylase, and amyloglucosidase, and then extracted with equal volume of methanol. The resulting extracts were examined for their reducing sugar content, total phenolic content (TPC), oxygen radical scavenging absorbance capacity (ORAC), hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, superoxide scavenging activity, and ferrous ion chelating potential. The amount of reducing sugar increased form 2.0% in the control sample to 21.4% in the sample treated with four fungal beta-glucanase units/g of bran. The increase in reducing sugar was also associated with subsequent increase of other extractable compounds. The total phenolic content as measured by Folin-Ciocalteu's method ranged from 0.50 to 4.80 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g of bran, whereas the ORAC values were 14.4-25.4 mu M of Trolox equivalents/g of bran. All the samples treated with carbohydrases had higher TPC content and higher ORAC values than the control sample (no enzyme treatment). In the hydroxyl radical scavenging assay, except for the alpha-amylase treated sample, all other samples demonstrated a greater inhibition power than the control. These results indicated that pre-treatment of oat bran with cell wall degrading enzymes (i.e. carbohydrases) is a way to increase the amount of extracted phenols as well as the antioxidant properties of oat bran samples.

"Several regulatory bodies have approved a health claim on the cholesterol-lowering effects of oat beta-glucan at levels of 3.0 g/d. The present study aimed to test whether 1.5g/d beta-glucan provided as ready-to-eat oat flakes was as effective in lowering cholesterol as 3.0 g/d from oats porridge. A 6-week randomised controlled trial was conducted in eighty-seven mildly hypercholesterolaemic (>= 5 mmol/l and <7.5 mmol/l) men and women assigned to one of three diet arms (25% energy (E%) protein; 45 E% carbohydrate; 30 E% fat, at energy requirements for weight maintenance): (1) minimal beta-glucan (control); (2) low-dose oat beta-glucan (1.5 g beta-glucan; oats low - OL) or (3) higher dose oat beta-glucan (3.0 g beta-glucan; oats high - OH). Changes in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline were assessed using a linear mixed model and repeated-measures ANOVA, adjusted for weight change. Total cholesterol reduced significantly in all groups (-78 (SD 13.8)%, -7.2 (SD 12.4)% and -55 (SD 9.3)% in the OH, OL and control groups), as did LDL-C (-84 (SD 18.5)%, - 8.5 (SD 18.5)% and -55 (SD 12.4)% in the OH, OL and control groups), but between-group differences were not significant. In responders only (n 60), beta-glucan groups had higher reductions in LDL-C (-18.3 (SD 11.1)% and -18.1 (SD 9.2)% in the OH and OL groups) compared with controls (-11.7 (SD 7.9)%; P=0.044).

"Objective: To determine the influence of porridge made with milk, honey, and either rolled oats (R) or pinhead oats (P) on postprandial glycemia and satiety. Methods: Fifteen healthy participants were recruited, but because of noncompliance with the protocol, only 13 participants were included in the final analysis. In a randomized, crossover design, participants consumed porridge made with milk, water, honey, and either R or P. Finger-prick blood samples were taken at baseline and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes following consumption of the porridge to determine blood glucose concentrations. Visual analog scales were used at the same time points to assess appetite sensations. Incremental area under the blood glucose concentration versus time curve (IAUC), ignoring area below the baseline, was used to assess glycemia. Results: Porridge made with P reduced the blood glucose IAUC by 19.51 mmol/L X 120 minutes (95% confidence interval: 5.18, 33.84 mmol/L X 120 minutes; p = 0.012), although no differences in peak or time to peak blood glucose concentrations were observed (p = 0.603 and 1.00, respectively). Hunger was not affected by the type of oats used (p = 0.991), yet participants felt fuller following consumption of R compared with P (p = 0.024).

"Lately, the organic cereals field has been progressively developing. A limitation of conventional untreated seed application plays an important role there. On the other hand, there has been a longtime deficiency of certified organic seeds. Therefore, oat was experimentally used as a model crop in order to demonstrate results of the assessment of particular biological traits of various seed categories (certified organic, conventional untreated, farm). The seeds' biological traits (energy of germination, germination, energy of emergence, emergence, thousand grain weight - TGW) were assessed before seeding and the impact of the seed quality on the grown seeds was also studied. Small-plot trials including four varieties of naked and hulled (common) oat were set up in three localities in the Czech Republic between 2010 and 2011. As for the quality of the seeds serving for the establishment of the small-plot trials, the conventional untreated seeds proved the highest quality for the energy of germination (86.3%), the germination (88.3%), the energy of emergence (72.8%), the emergence (79.1%) and the TGW (31.9 g). On the other hand, as for the organic seeds, these originating from the certified organic crop stands proved the highest quality for the energy of germination (90.4%), the germination (92.6%), the energy of emergence (79.4%), the emergence (85.8%) and the TGW (30.8 g), just as these originating from the farm crop stand the energy of germination (90.2%), the germination (88.3%), the energy of emergence (79.2%), the emergence (85.4%) and the TGW (30.4 g). The energy of germination, the germination and the energy of laboratory emergence were (p<0.05) influenced by a locality factor (ANOVA). The impact of the other factors was not significant, however, as the research results demonstrated an obvious trend.

"The current research was conducted to evaluate the forage yield and quality of stands of common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) in various combinations with annual cereals such as oat (Avena sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Mixture rates were formulated using three combinations of common vetch-cereal (75:25, 50:50 and 25:75) under rain fed conditions in the southern Marmara Region, Turkey, during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 growing seasons. The field trials were arranged in a randomized block design with three replications. The averages of the two-year findings indicated that the highest dry matter was determined at pure oat stands, followed by common vetch-oat mixtures at ratios of 50:50 and 75:25. The highest crude protein yield was obtained from pure common vetch and common vetch-oat (75:25) stands. A common vetch-oat mixture at 75:25 can be recommended for experimental and similar ecologies because of its higher dry matter and crude protein yields.",628,1,99,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,154
"Many studies have reported that oats could effectively reduce the serum cholesterol levels in humans, and the beta-glucan in oat is believed to be responsible for this physiologic effect. Probiotics are live microorganisms that can confer a healthy benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts. There is an increasing use of these microorganisms in food, aiming to balance intestinal microflora and alleviate dysfunction of the human gastrointestinal tract. However, a number of studies have shown that only 10-30% of these probiotic bacteria could survive after passing through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Lactobacillus acidophilus is used as a probiotic bacterium in many probiotic foods. However, L. acidophilus shows poor growth in cereal products due to its poor hydrolytic ability of protein and macromolecule carbohydrates. The aim of the present study was to combine Rhizopus oryzae-fermented oat mash and Lactobacillus acidophilus in an oat-based synbiotic beverage. Several factors, including starter culture concentration, R. oryzae-fermented oat mash and skim milk powder, were investigated. The nutritional contents in R. oryzae-fermented oat flour were just sufficient for survival but not growth of L. acidophilus. Adding sucrose (1% or 2%, w/v) did not improve the proliferation of L. acidophilus; however, L. acidophilus grew quickly when skim milk powder (1% or 2%, w/v) was added. When 5.5% R. oryzae-fermented oat mash with 2% added skim milk powder was used, the viable cell counts reached about 9.0 log cfu/ml at the end of 10 h fermentation. The concentration of beta-glucans (about 781 mg/l) was not significantly lowered during fermentation.",629,-1,-1,0,1,99,1,2,1,1,253
"Physiologic effects of dietary oat beta-glucan and low and high dietary calcium-phosphorus (CaP) on intestinal morphology and gene expression related to SCFA absorption, mucus production, inflammation, and peptide digestion have not been established in weaned mammals. We therefore randomized 32 weaned pigs into 4 equal groups that received a cornstarch-casein-based diet with low (65% of the Ca and P requirement) and high (125 and 115% of the Ca and P requirement, respectively) CaP levels and low- and high-CaP diets supplemented with 8.95% oat beta-glucan concentrate for 14 d. High-CaP diets downregulated duodenal expression of IL-1 beta (P < 0.05) by 30% compared with low-CaP diets. Furthermore, high-CaP diets reduced (P < 0.05) cecal crypt depth by 14% compared with low-CaP diets. Dietary beta-glucan upregulated the expression of cecal MCT1 (P < 0.05) by 40% and that of colonic IL-6 (P < 0.05) by 142% compared with the control diet. Correlation analysis indicated that cecal MCT1 (r = 0.99, P < 0.001) and colonic IL-6 (r = 0.84, P < 0.05) expression was positively related to luminal butyrate and total SCFA, respectively, indicating that beta-glucan may partly modify gene expression via increased SCFA generation. In conclusion, p-glucan and CaP levels modulated the expression of selected genes and morphology in the postweaning period, but effects were specific to intestinal segment. The present results further indicate that, in addition to being essential nutrients for bone accretion, dietary CaP level may modify the intestinal tissue response in young pigs. J.

"In this study, medium oat bran samples were treated with four cell wall carbohydrases degrading enzymes (viscozyme (R) L, alpha-amylase, amyloglucosidase, celluclast (R)). Their effects on protein extraction efficiency and, on antioxidant properties of obtained protein isolates and resulting alcalase hydrolysates were investigated. The results showed that sample pre-treated with amyloglucosidase (8 units/g) had the higher protein content (82%) while celluclast (5-60 endo-glucanase units (EGU)/g) pre-treated samples had protein content similar to that of control (54%). In the oxygen radical absorbance assay (ORAC) all samples of protein isolates had significantly higher peroxyl radical scavenging activity than the control. The sample pre-treated with alpha-amylase (2300 units/g) displayed the highest activity with an ORAC value of 165 +/- 16 mu M Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g. Proteins were hydrolyzed with alcalase and radical scavenging activities of hydrolysates assessed by ORAC and HO center dot radical assays. Sample pre-treated with viscozyme 1.5 Fungal Beta-glucanase Units (FBU)/g was the more active in both assays: ORAC value 521 +/- 53 mu M TE/g and HO center dot radical inhibition 26.3 +/- 1.5%.

"Drought stress is the most common adverse environmental condition that can seriously reduce crop productivity. Increasing crops resistance to drought stress would be the most economical approach to improve agricultural productivity and to reduce agricultural use of fresh water resources. As a result, understanding of the mechanisms of drought tolerance and breeding for drought-resistant crop plants has been the major goal of plant biologists and crop breeders. We evaluated ten oat cultivars under stressed and non-stressed conditions using a randomized complete block design in 2004 and 2005. The drought tolerance indices, G MP, MP and STI were determined as best indices, which can be used in breeding programs. The cultivar Paisley was found to be good for cultivation under stressed conditions, but other cultivars (Derby and Donald) had low yield and were not suitable for cultivation in Shahrekord region.",632,99,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,5,139
"Coumarin is a naturally occurring flavouring substance in cinnamon and many other plants. It is known that coumarin can cause liver toxicity in several species, and it is considered a non-genotoxic carcinogen in rodents. By using the bench mark dose approach we re-assessed coumarin toxicity and established a new TDI for coumarin of 0.07 mg/kg bw/day. Oral intake of coumarin is related to consumption of cinnamon-containing foods and food supplements. Cinnamon is a widely used spice in Norway, and can be used as topping on oatmeal porridge. Based on analyses of coumarin in Norwegian foods, intake calculations for children and adults were conducted, and a risk assessment of coumarin in the Norwegian population was performed. Intake estimates of coumarin show that small children eating oatmeal porridge several times a week sprinkled with cinnamon could have a coumarin intake of 1.63 mg/kg bw/day and may exceeding the TDI with several folds. Adults drinking cinnamon-based tea and consuming cinnamon supplements also can exceed TDI. The coumarin intake could exceed the TDI by 7- to 20-fold in some intake scenarios. Such large daily exceedances of TDI, even for a limited time period of 1-2 weeks, cause concern of adverse health effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",633,-1,-1,99,99,-1,0,3,0,2,205
"Oat consumption is regarded as having significant health benefits. The enrichment of white salted noodles with oat flour would provide a potential health benefit but may affect the texture and sensory quality. Oat cultivars grown in Western Australia (Yallara, Kojonup, Mitika, Carrolup, and new line SV97181-8) and a commercial oat variety were milled into flour and added to wheat flour at 10, 20, and 30% to produce oat-enriched white salted noodles. The purpose of the study was to determine the quality characteristics of the oat flours and to assess the influence the oat flour blends had on noodle texture, color, and sensory characteristics. In addition, another goal was to determine whether the different oat cultivars had similar potential to provide health benefits by measuring the beta-glucan content before and after processing. The results indicated that protein, ash content, and noodle firmness increased with the increased percentage of oat flour in the noodle formulations, whereas the pasting properties of the noodle wheat-oat flour blends did not differ significantly. The color of raw noodle sheets and boiled noodles changed significantly with oat incorporation and resulted in lower lightness/ brightness, higher redness, lower yellowness, and lower color stability in comparison to standard wheat white salted noodles. Noodles made with the lowest oat percentage (10%) scored highest for all sensory parameters and were significantly different in appearance, color, and overall acceptability compared with noodles made with 20 and 30% oat flour. The beta-glucan content of the flour blends increased with the increase in the level of oat incorporation but subsequently decreased during processing into noodles. The decrease in the beta-glucan content varied across the different oat cultivars and levels of incorporation into the noodles. A new oat cultivar, SV97181-8, exhibited the least beta-glucan loss during processing.

"The aim of present work was to investigate the effect of solid-state fermentation with filamentous fungi (Aspergillus oryzae var. effuses, Aspergillus oryzae, and Aspergillus niger) on total phenolics content (TPC), flavonoids, and antioxidant activities of four subfractions of oat, namely, n-hexane, ethyl acetate (EA), n-butanol, and water, and compare them to their corresponding subfractions of unfermented oat. The TPC and total flavonoids increased dramatically, especially in EA subfractions (p < 0.05). The levels of antioxidant activity of subfractions were also significantly enhanced (p < 0.05). The highest antioxidant activities were also found in the EA subfractions. The polyphenols in EA were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography at 280 nm. Most polyphenols were increased remarkably, especially ferulic and caffeic acids. There was a clear correlation between the TPC and antioxidant activity. In conclusion, fungi fermentation is a potential bioprocess for increasing the TPC, flavonoids, and antioxidant activities of oat-based food.",635,1,1,99,-1,1,3,1,0,1,149
"Naked oat is an important food and forage crop and principally distributed across arid and water scarce regions of China. The objective of this study was to determine the gas exchange to light, growth and biomass accumulation of naked oat (Avena nuda L.) under three soil humidity levels (high, moderate and low) using a new type of negative hydraulic pressure controlled auto irrigator. Net photosynthetic rate (A(n)), transpiration rate (E), instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUEi) and instantaneous light-use efficiency (LUEi) were decreased as soil humidity was reduced. Under low soil humidity, maximum A(n) decreased by 43% and 44%, and light saturation point (LSP) was reduced by 40% and 41%, moreover, light compensation point (LCP) increased by 85% and 123%, than under moderate and high soil humidity. There was little effects on plant height, tiller number and stem diameter under moderate and high soil humidity but significantly decreased among parameters (exceeding 6%, 60% and 13%) under low soil humidity. The highest biomass accumulation was recorded under moderate soil humidity, which was significantly enhanced by 21.2% and 108.1% both high and low soil humidity, respectively. This study concluded that imposed drought in appropriate stages on naked oat has little effect on gas exchange and growth, on the contrary, could clearly improve biomass accumulation.",636,99,1,0,99,99,1,0,1,3,210
"The relationship between weather data and agronomical factors and deoxynivalenol (DON) levels in oats was examined with the aim of developing a predictive model. Data were collected from a total of 674 fields during periods of up to 10 years in Finland, Norway and Sweden, and included DON levels in the harvested oats crop, agronomical factors and weather data. The results show that there was a large regional variation in DON levels, with higher levels in one region in Norway compared with other regions in Norway, Finland and Sweden. In this region the median DON level was 1000 ng g(-1) and the regulatory limit for human consumption (1750 ng g(-1)) was exceeded in 28% of the samples. In other regions the median DON levels ranged from 75 to 270 ng g(-1), and DON levels exceeded 1750 ng g(-1) in 3-8% of the samples. Including more variables than region in a multiple regression model only increased the adjusted coefficient of determination from 0.17 to 0.24, indicating that very little of the variation in DON levels could be explained by weather data or agronomical factors. Thus, it was not possible to predict DON levels based on the variables included in this study. Further studies are needed to solve this problem. Apparently the infection and/or growth of DON producing Fusarium species are promoted in certain regions. One possibility may be to study the species distribution of fungal communities and their changes during the oats cultivation period in more detail.",637,99,99,99,0,99,0,0,1,4,246
"The brewing industry is facing an ever increasing challenge to become more cost-effective, while at the same time maintaining or improving product quality. Brewing with unmalted oats (Avena saliva L.) has the potential to reduce the costs of raw materials. However, the replacement of malted barley with unmalted oats can also adversely affect the quality and processability of mashes, worts, and beers. In this study, brewing with unmalted oats (0-40%) and malted barley was carried out in a 60-L pilot plant. The impact of various levels of oats on mashing, lautering, and fermentation performance was monitored in detail and the quality of the final beers was evaluated using Lab-on-a-Chip capillary electrophoresis as well as standard methods specified by Mitteleuropaische Brautechnische Analysenkommission (MEBAK), European Brewery Convention (EBC), or the American Society of Brewing Chemists (ASBC). It has been found that the P-glucan content and viscosity of mashes and worts increased significantly with increasing amounts of oats. In addition, the use of 20% or more oat adjunct resulted in a clearly increased lautering time. The replacement of barley malt with unmalted oats also had adverse effects on total soluble nitrogen (TSN), free amino nitrogen (FAN), and extract levels in worts. The foam stability of the final beers decreased significantly using 20% oats or more. However, their sensory quality improved with increasing levels of oat adjunct.",638,99,99,1,99,0,1,0,1,3,223
"The potential of sourdough to improve bread quality of barley and oat enriched wheat breads may depend on the characteristics of the added flour (cereal type, variety, extraction rate). We compared the effect of different barley flours and oat bran (substitution level 40%), unfermented and as sourdoughs (20% of total flour), on composite wheat dough and bread characteristics by combining empirical rheological analyses (DoughLab, SMS/Kieffer Dough and Gluten Extensibility Rig) with small-scale baking of hearth loaves. Whole grain barley flour sourdough increased resistance to extension (Rmax) of the dough and improved the form ratio of hearth loaves compared to unfermented whole grain barley flour. However, sourdough showed little effect on the breads prepared with sifted barley flour or oat bran. The breads made with oat bran showed highest bread volume, lowest crumb firmness and highest beta-glucan calcofluor weight average molecular weight (MW). The heat treatment of oat bran inactivated endogenous enzymes resulting in less beta-glucan degradation. High MW beta-glucans will increase the viscosity of the doughs water phase, which in turn may stabilise gas cells and may therefore be the reason for the higher bread volume of the oat bran breads observed in our study.

"The genus Avena contains about 27 different species from diploid to hexaploid with different genome compositions. Wild oat is among the worst weeds of grain crops. It is important to identify the genetic diversity of wild oat genetic resources for its effective management and for evaluating its accessions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of 59 accessions of two wild oat species A. fatua and A. sterilis ssp. ludoviciana. Eight SSR markers were used to assess the genetic variation of 59 accessions gathered from different parts of Iran. All microsatellite markers showed polymorphism. The average number of alleles per each SSR locus was 3.75 for A. fatua and 4.62 for A. sterilis ssp. ludoviciana. The average PIC value was 0.7 for both A. fatua and A. sterilis ssp. ludoviciana. Cluster analysis based on Neighbor-Joining (NJ) showed a dendrogram with two clusters and splitting feature of A. fatua and A. sterilis ssp. ludoviciana which congruent with known information on different growing areas.

"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a health problem throughout the world and is associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Thus, the purpose of the present work was to evaluate the effects of a dietary pattern (DP; soy protein, nopal, chia seed, and oat) on the biochemical variables of MetS, the AUC for glucose and insulin, glucose intolerance (GI), the relationship of the presence of certain polymorphisms related to MetS, and the response to the DP. In this randomized trial, the participants consumed their habitual diet but reduced by 500 kcal for 2 wk. They were then assigned to the placebo (P; n = 351 or DP (n = 32) group and consumed the reduced energy diet plus the P or DP beverage 1235 kcal) minus the energy provided by these for 2 mo. All participants had decreases in body weight (BW), BMI, and waist circumference during the 2-mo treatment (P < 0.00011; however, only the DP group had decreases in serum TG, C-reactive protein (CRP), and AUC for insulin and GI after a glucose tolerance test. Interestingly, participants in the DP group with MetS and the ABCA1 R2300 variant had a greater decrease in BW and an increase in serum adiponectin concentration after 2 mo of dietary treatment than those with the ABCA1 R230R variant. The results from this study suggest that lifestyle interventions involving specific DP for the treatment of MetS could be more effective if local foods and genetic variations of the population are considered.

"Climate change is anticipated to affect European agriculture, including the risk of emerging or re-emerging feed and food hazards. Indirectly, climate change may influence such hazards (e.g. the occurrence of mycotoxins) due to geographic shifts in the distribution of major cereal cropping systems and the consequences this may have for crop rotations. This paper analyses the impact of climate on cropping shares of maize, oat and wheat on a 50-km square grid across Europe (45-65 degrees N) and provides model-based estimates of the changes in cropping shares in response to changes in temperature and precipitation as projected for the time period around 2040 by two regional climate models (RCM) with a moderate and a strong climate change signal, respectively. The projected cropping shares are based on the output from the two RCMs and on algorithms derived for the relation between meteorological data and observed cropping shares of maize, oat and wheat. The observed cropping shares show a south-to-north gradient, where maize had its maximum at 45-55 degrees N, oat had its maximum at 55-65 degrees N, and wheat was more evenly distributed along the latitudes in Europe. Under the projected climate changes, there was a general increase in maize cropping shares, whereas for oat no areas showed distinct increases. For wheat, the projected changes indicated a tendency towards higher cropping shares in the northern parts and lower cropping shares in the southern parts of the study area. The present modelling approach represents a simplification of factors determining the distribution of cereal crops, and also some uncertainties in the data basis were apparent. A promising way of future model improvement could be through a systematic analysis and inclusion of other variables, such as key soil properties and socio-economic conditions, influencing the comparative advantages of specific crops.",645,99,1,1,99,1,3,0,0,2,295
"Farinograph and extensograph tests were applied to determine the effect of carob fibre and oat wholemeal on the rheological properties of wheat flour dough, and characterisation of relationships between the results of the tests was performed. The applied additions of carob fibre (1-5%) and oat wholemeal (5-25%) increased the water absorption of the dough within nearly identical ranges (56-59%). Enrichment with carob fibre made the dough more rheologically stable during mixing compared to dough with oat wholemeal. In the extension test, dough with an admixture of carob fibre was more resistant, but it was less extensible than dough with oat wholemeal. Analysis of relationships of the extensograph traits to the farinograph ones revealed that longer periods of development of dough enriched with the additions under examination involved the formation of a looser dough structure, as a result of which its resistance to extension, ratio number and energy decreased and the dough extensibility increased. Opposite effects were caused by increasing farinograph elasticity and its loss. The degree of softening, negatively correlating with resistance, ratio number and energy, coupled with water absorption or with loss of elasticity, permitted their more accurate prediction. In turn, combining in a regression model of water absorption with development time or with elasticity was the most suitable for predicting dough extensibility. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Fusarium langsethiae has been isolated from infected cereals in central and northern Europe where it has been identified in the last decade as the main species involved in the occurrence of high levels of T-2 and HT-2 toxins, mainly in oats. The efficacy of three fungicides (prochloraz, tebuconazole, fenpropimorph) for controlling growth of two strains of F. langsethiae isolated from oats was examined at 0.96 and 0.98 a(w) at 15,20 and 25 degrees C on oat-based media. The concentrations necessary for 50 and 90% growth inhibition (ED(50) and ED(90) values) were determined. The effect on the trichothecene type A mycotoxins 1-2 and HT-2 was also determined. Without fungicides both strains grew faster at 0.98 than at 0.96 a(w) and the influence of temperature on growth rates was 25 > 20 > 15 degrees C. Prochloraz and tebuconazole were more effective than fenpropimorph against F. langsethiae. Strain, temperature and type of fungicide significantly influenced the ED(50) and ED(90), values for growth. The concentration ranges under different environmental conditions were: prochloraz (0.03-0.1 and 0.3-1.5), tebuconazole (0.06-0.9 and 1.3-8.2), and fenpropimorph (22-59 and 125-215 mg l(-1)). Production of T-2 and HT-2 toxins was influenced by temperature, a(w), type of fungicide and dose. Levels of T-2 were usually higher than those of HT-2 under the same conditions. The biosynthesis of T-2 toxin increased after 10 day incubation, but was reduced with decreasing temperature and increasing fungicide dose. At 0.98 a(w) T-2 levels increased in cultures containing fenpropimorph while at 0.96 a(w) the toxin concentrations increased in response to the other two fungicides. Low doses of prochloraz or tebuconazole enhanced toxin production when compared with untreated cultures for strain 2004-59 at 0.96 a(w) and 20-25 degrees C.

"Fusarium head blight, incited by the fungus Fusarium graminearum, primarily affects wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgarum), while oat (Avena saliva) appears to be more resistant. Although this has generally been attributed to the open panicle of oats, we hypothesized that a chemical component of oats might contribute to this resistance. To test this hypothesis, we created culture media made of wheat, barley, and oat flour gels (6 g of flour in 20 ml of water, gelled by autoclaving) and inoculated these with plugs of F. graminearum from actively growing cultures. Fusarium growth was measured from the diameter of the fungal plaque. Plaque diameter was significantly smaller on oat flour cultures than on wheat or barley cultures after 40 to 80 h of growth. Ergosterol concentration was also significantly lower in oat cultures than in wheat cultures after growth. A hexane extract from oats added to wheat flour also inhibited Fusarium growth, and Fusarium grew better on hexane-defatted oat flour. The growth of Fusarium on oat flour was significantly and negatively affected by the oil concentration in the oat, in a linear relationship. A hexane-soluble chemical in oat flour appears to inhibit Fusarium growth and might contribute to oat's resistance to Fusarium head blight. Oxygenated fatty acids, including hydroxy, dihydroxy, and epoxy fatty acids, were identified in the hexane extracts and are likely candidates for causing the inhibition.",648,1,99,99,99,0,1,0,1,3,229

"Most physiological studies on oat beta (beta)-glucan referred to attenuation of blood glucose and insulin responses in both healthy and diabetic individuals. The main purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of oat beta-glucan on glucose metabolism in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and the activities of intestinal disaccharidases in the diabetic mice and in vitro. Meanwhile, the potentially regulative mechanisms on intestinal disaccharidases were discussed. Normal and diabetic mice, treated with metformin, were used as the negative and positive controls, respectively. The results indicated that oat beta-glucan could regulate the glucose metabolism and inhibit the activities of intestinal disaccharidases in vivo and in vitro (p < 0.01), especially when using a high-dose, which suggested that oat beta-glucan could effectively improve the internal environment of intestinal tract and would be a potential alpha (alpha)-glycosidase inhibitor.

"The antioxidant antioxidant properties, damaged starch, beta glucan extractability and physicochemical properties of ten different oat cultivars were studied after sand roasting at 280 degrees C for 15 s. The groat content within the cultivars varied from 6.59 to 7.76 g/10 g oats. Roasting lowered the length/breadth ratio and bulk density and resulted in puffing of the groats. Color characteristics a* indicating redness and b* indicating yellowness and nonenzymatic browning index significantly (p < 0.05) increased upon roasting. The total phenolic (mu g FAE/g) and flavonoid content (mu g/g) decreased significantly by 11.4-50.2% and 22.7-49.9%, respectively. An increase in reducing power (mu mol AAE/g) ranging from 1.1 to 37.6% and metal chelating activity ranging from 13.2 to 180.2% was observed in the roasted groats. The DPPH radical scavenging activity in the roasted groats increased by 4.6-73.0%. The peak viscosity of the roasted groat flour decreased by 9.1-51.1% while the final viscosity decreased by 15.4-57.5%. The damaged starch content in the groats increased after roasting and the increase ranged from 72 to 82%. Roasting significantly increased the extractable beta glucan content in the groats by 9.8-61.1%. It was concluded that roasting significantly affects the physicochemical and pasting behavior of groats and increases the availability of phytochemicals like beta glucan and the total antioxidant activity.

"Background: There is increasing global acceptance that viscous soluble fibers lower serum LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), but most evidence for this comes from studies in Caucasians. To see if oat beta-glucan lowers LDL-C in Caucasians and non-Caucasians we conducted a post-hoc analysis of the results of a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multi-center clinical trial whose primary aim was to determine if molecular-weight (MW) influenced the LDL-C-lowering effect of oat beta-glucan. Results: Caucasian and non-Caucasian subjects with LDL-C-C >= 3.0 and <= 5.0 mmol/L (n = 786 screened, n = 400 ineligible, n = 19 refused, n = 367 randomized, n = 345 completed, n = 1 excluded for missing ethnicity) were randomly assigned to consume cereal containing wheat-fiber (Control, n = 74: 13 Caucasian: non-Caucasian) or 3 g high-MW (3H, 2,250,000 g/mol, n = 67: 19), 4 g medium-MW (4 M, 850,000 g/mol, n = 50: 17), 3 g medium-MW (3M, 530,000 g/mol, n = 54: 9) or 4 g low-MW (4 L, 210,000 g/mol, n = 51: 12) oat beta-glucan daily for 4 weeks.

In all subjects, compared to control, 3 H, 4 M and 3 M reduced LDL-C significantly by 4.8 to 6.5%, but 4 L had no effect. Compared to control, the bioactive oat b-glucan treatments (3H, 4M and 3M) reduced LDL-C by a combined mean (95% CI) of 0.18 (0.06, 0.31) mmol/L (4.8%, n = 171, p = 0.004) in Caucasians, a value not significantly different from the 0.37 (0.09, 0.65) mmol/L (10.3%, n = 45, p = 0.008) reduction in non-Caucasians. Conclusion: We conclude that oat beta-glucan reduces LDL-C in both Caucasians and non-Caucasians; there was insufficient power to determine if the magnitude of LDL-C-lowering differed by ethnicity.",652,0,1,0,1,1,3,0,2,0,304
"The interaction between oat beta-glucan and other food components has the potential to influence starch digestibility and consequently affect its bioactivity in reducing glycemic responses. Blood glucose concentrations were measured before and after ingesting wheat and oat granolas, with 0.6 and 6.2 g of beta-glucan, respectively, and two starch doses (40 and 60 g). As the in vitro extract viscosity of beta-glucan increased, the in vitro starch digestibility was reduced and the glucose responses were lowered. The peak blood glucose response (PBGR) and the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) were lower in the 40 g than in the 60 g starch formulation. beta-Glucan was significantly more active in reducing PBGR and iAUC when the beta-glucan/starch ratio was 1.6:10 rather than 1.1:10. This information is valuable for new product development and for quality assessment of bioactive foods containing oat beta-glucan. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"The understanding of how fibre-rich meals regulate molecular events at a gene level is limited. This pilot study aimed to investigate changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy subjects after consumption of an oat bran-rich meal. Fifteen subjects (8 men and 7 women, aged 20-28 years) ingested meals with oat bran or a control meal after an overnight fast. Blood samples for analysis of postprandial glucose, insulin and triglyceride concentrations were taken during 3 h, while PBMCs for microarray gene expression profiling from five men and five women were taken before and 2 h after the meal. Analysis of transcriptome data was performed with linear mixed models to determine differentially expressed genes in response either to meal intake or meal content, and enrichment analysis was used to identify functional gene sets responding to meal intake and specifically to oat bran intake. Meal intake as such affected gene expression for genes mainly involved in metabolic stress; indicating increased inflammation due to the switch from fasting to fed state. The oat bran meal affected gene sets associated with a lower insulin level, compared with the control meal. The gene sets included genes involved in insulin secretion and beta-cell development, but also protein synthesis and genes related to cancer diseases. The oat bran meal also significantly lowered postprandial blood insulin IAUC compared to control. Further studies are needed to compare these acute effects with the long-term health effects of oat bran.",654,0,1,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,243
"The breadmaking potential of six oat varieties was compared with and related to their physicochemical properties. The most significant differences in the bread characteristics were found in the crumb structure. The varieties Buggy, Energie, and Zorro resulted in good bread quality with an even gas-cell distribution characterized by a high number of relatively small pores. In contrast, Typhon, Ivory, and Nord 08/311 each had a large hole in the center of the crumb and accordingly poor quality. Breads differed little in specific volume, bake loss, and density. Rheological analysis revealed positive effects of low batter resistance to deformation on oat bread quality. On the basis of the physicochemical characterization, protein and fat contents were identified as key factors responsible for differences observed in bread quality, provided that starch damage and water-hydration capacity were low. Additionally, high setback and final viscosity, as determined by Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) analysis, positively affected oat bread quality. High alpha-amylase activity was found to influence negatively the breadmaking performance of oats. Overall, protein, fat, dietary fiber content, starch pasting properties, and alpha-amylase activity were responsible for the breadmaking properties of oat varieties.",655,0,99,99,0,99,0,0,2,3,187
"Albumin, globulin and glutelin fractions were prepared from chickpea and oat seeds using sequential extractions. Molecular characteristics of individual protein fractions were investigated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in combination with proteomic techniques. SDS-PAGE results revealed that chickpea albumin and globulin fractions (C-Ab and C-Gb) showed protein bands with molecular weights (MWs) related to subunits of legumin (US globulin) and pea vicilin (7S globulin); oat protein fractions (O-Ab, O-Gb and O-Gt) showed most protein bands with MWs related to subunits of oat 12S globulin (avenalin). With proteomic analysis, eighteen tryptic peptides from chickpea globulin fraction showed sequence homology that corresponded to chickpea legumin alpha- and beta-subunit (NCBI accession number: gi vertical bar 6273402; theoretical mass 56,216 Da) while sixteen tryptic peptides from chickpea albumin fraction (C-Ab) were identified as chickpea provicilin precursor (NCBI accession number: gi vertical bar 82173888; theoretical mass 51,390 Da); fifteen tryptic peptides from oat protein fractions were identified with origin from oat 12S seed storage globulin 1 (NCBI accession number: gi vertical bar 134918; theoretical mass 58,508 Da). The identified tryptic peptide. ALIVPQNFAIAAK, was commonly found in chickpea glutelin fraction (C-Gt), rice glutelin fraction (R-Gt), and oat albumin, globulin and glutelin fractions (O-Ab, O-Gb and O-Gt).

"Water-soluble beta-glucan (BG) extracted from a high-BG oat line was treated with different amounts of lichenase (1 -> 3)(1 -> 4)-beta-D-glucanase) enzyme to yield three different molecular weight (MW) BG extracts. Low (LMW-BG, 157,000), medium (MMW-BG, 277,000), and high (HMW-BG, 560,000) MW BG extracts were added to plain muffin formulations at a level of 0.52% (0.42% in the batter, 0.52% in the resultant muffins) to investigate the effect of MW of BG on textural and bile acid (BA) binding properties of the muffins. In addition, treatments were prepared containing LMW-BG, MMW-BG, and HMW-BG extracts in amounts providing equivalent batter firmness as determined on a texture analyzer. Resultant BG concentrations (and per serving amounts) of these muffins were 1.36% (0.81 g/60 g muffin), 1.05% (0.63 g/60 g muffin), and 0.52% (0.31 g/60 g muffin), respectively; thus, the LMW treatment complied with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration health claim requiring 0.75 g of BG per serving. The firmness, springiness, and BA-binding capacity of the muffins were unaffected by the MW of BG. However, when added at the maximum limit for equivalent batter firmness, the LMW treatment was more firm and less springy than the HMW treatment. Furthermore, BA-binding capacities of LMW and MMW fractions tended to be greater than that of the HMW fraction when added at the maximum limit. These results add further evidence to the importance of fine-tuning BG structure to provide maximum health benefits while maintaining high product quality.",657,1,99,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,241
"Oats are a rich source of beta-glucans and bioactive phytochemicals. The established health-beneficial properties of oats have led to an increase in the consumption of oats and oat-based food products in recent years. The objective of the present study was to analyse and compare the polyphenol content and total antioxidant capacity (via FRAP (ferric ion reducing antioxidant power) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) inhibition) of 30 commercially available oat-based breakfast cereals. All of the breakfast cereals analysed were a significant source of polyphenols (1506-1853 mu g gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g) and antioxidants (1682-3542 mu mol/l FRAP: 30-201% inhibition of DPPH compared to gallic acid standard). There was little difference between premium and budget brand varieties of the breakfast cereals. The polyphenol levels in an average serving (40 g) of an oat-based breakfast cereal are comparable to those found in fruits and vegetables. Overall, our findings suggest that consumption of oat-based breakfast cereals could be a significant contributor to the total polyphenol content and antioxidant potential of the diet.

"The objective of this work was promote oxidation of beta-glucan from oat bran with hydrogen peroxide at different concentration levels (0.3%, 0.6% and 0.9% H2O2) and reaction times (30 and 60 min), and evaluate the physicochemical and functional properties of isedoxidised beta-glucan with in-vitro tests. An increase in carbonyl and carboxyl groups and alterations in swelling power were verified in the oxidised beta-glucan. The cholic acid binding capacity increased in the oxidised beta-glucan: however, the fat binding capacity was not affected. After chemical digestion, the available glucose of the oxidised beta-glucan was increased. Oxidation with hydrogen peroxide decreased the viscosity, hardness, adhesiveness and gumminess of the beta-glucan gels. More studies are necessary to determine the effect of the oxidative treatment of beta-glucan on its technological properties in food products, and biological properties should be examined with in-vivo studies.

"Few data are available about the effects of complexation of polyphenols with polysaccharide on their bioavailability. The complex of tea polyphenols (TP) with oat beta-glucan was characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force microscopy, and solid-state C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The results indicated that the bonds which governed the interaction between TP and oat beta-glucan were strong hydrogen bonds. The in vitro antioxidant activity of TP, beta-glucan, their complex, and physical mixture was assessed using four systems, namely, DPPH center dot, OH center dot, and O-2(center dot-) scavenging activities and reducing power. The complexation and blending of TP and beta-glucan exhibited different impacts on the index of in vitro and in vivo antioxidant capacities. In the concentration range of 0.5-2.5 mg mL(-1),the complex had highest O-2(center dot-) scavenging activity, whereas the highest OH center dot scavenging activity was found with the physical mixture. For antioxidant testing in vivo, there was no significant difference between the complex and the physical mixture in terms of glutathione peroxidase activity and levels of malondialdehyde and total antioxidant capacity in serums. However, the complex exhibited much higher activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in livers than the physical mixture.

"two experimental lines N979-5-2-4 (N979) and IA95111 (IA95) and a retail oat bran, to represent wet and dry food systems. N979 and IA95 had greater % beta-glucan and protein, less starch, greater water solubility index than other brans. Slurries of ground N979 bran had the greatest peak viscosity among all bran types. The adhesiveness of porridge was positively correlated and the firmness of fresh muffins was negatively correlated with % beta-glucan. No relationship was found between % beta-glucan and mouth coating of porridge during sensory evaluation. IA95 and N979 muffins were rated to have greater dome shape and coarser surface texture than Jim and Paul muffins. Although beta-glucan could increase the adhesiveness of a wet oat food and make a dry oat food less firm, the impact of beta-glucan on the sensory properties was minimal.",661,99,99,1,0,99,1,0,1,3,135
"A previous study showed beta-glucan with low molecular weight (MW, 1.56 x 10(5) g/mol) bound more bile acid and produced greater amounts of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) than did beta-glucan with high MW (M-n = 6.87 x 10(5) g/mol). In the current study, beta-glucan extracted from oat flour was fractionated into six different MW levels (high MW, 7.09 x 10(5); low level I (L1), 3.48 x 10(5); L2, 2.42 x 10(5); L3, 1.61 x 10(5); L4, 0.87 x 10(5); and L5, 0.46 x 10(5) g/mol) and evaluated to find the optimum MW affecting in vitro bile acid binding and fermentation. The beta-glucan fractions with 2.42 x 10(5)-1.61 x 10(5) g/mol (L2 and L3) bound the greatest amounts of bile acid. After 24 h of fermentation, no differences were found in total SCFA formation among L1, L2, L3, and L4 fractions; however, the high MW and L5 MW fractions produced lower amounts of total SCFA. Thus, the optimum MW of beta-glucan to affect both hypocholesterolemic and antitumorigenic in vitro effects was in the range of 2.42 x 10(5)-1.61 x 10(5) g/mol. This MW range also was the most water-soluble among the MWs evaluated.",662,0,1,99,99,1,2,0,1,2,192
"The traditional production of mineral N and P fertilisers is unsustainable due its reliance on fossil fuels in the case of N, and on limited mineral resource stocks in the case of P. The use of alternative or complementary fertilisers that originate from organic waste materials is gaining interest. Organic farms, especially arable organic farms without livestock, need usable sources of plant nutrients. Meat bone meal (MBM), a potential organic fertiliser for agricultural crops, contains considerable amounts of nutrients (on average 8% N, 5% P, 1% K and 10% Ca). In EU countries, Commission regulation (EC) No 181/2006 authorised the use of MBM as an organic fertiliser. In this study, MBM was compared to conventional mineral NPK fertiliser. Two randomised complete block split-plot field experiments were conducted: one with spring barley (Hordeum vulgare) in two years; and another with oat (Avena sativa) for three years, including a fourth year of testing for residual effect. Compared to mineral fertiliser (20% N, 3% P and 9% K), MBM was applied at three N levels: 60, 90 and 120 kg N ha(-1). The grain yield of both cereal species supported by MBM, did not differ from the yield obtained with the mineral fertiliser at any N level. At 120 kg N ha(-1), the grain yield level with either type was ca. 4500 kg ha(-1) of barley and 5000 kg ha(-1) of oat, representing fair averages for Finnish conditions. Moreover, MBM and mineral fertilisation showed no differences in quality in terms of 1000-grain weight, test-weight, protein content and protein yield. Since MBM has a low N/P ratio, P was applied in surplus to attain comparable N levels. Therefore MBM fertilisation should be fitted for crop rotation and for meeting environmental requirements.",663,99,99,99,0,1,1,0,1,3,287
"Background/Objectives: Oat bran shows cholesterol-lowering properties, but its effects on other cardiovascular risk markers are less frequently investigated. This study examined the effects of oat bran on blood lipids, hemostatic factors and energy utilization. Subjects/Methods: A double-blind, randomized crossover study in 24 adults (age 25.2 +/- 2.7 years; body mass index: 24.9 +/- 2.9 kg/m(2)), who completed two 2-week dietary intervention periods: low-fiber diet (control) or an oat bran (control + 102g oat bran/day) diet. Fasting blood samples were drawn before and after each period, and 3-day fecal samples were collected during the last week of each period. Results: Total cholesterol decreased by 14% during the oat bran period compared with 4% during the control period (P<0.001). Non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased by 16% in the oat bran period compared with 3% in the control period (P<0.01), as did total triacylglycerol (21 vs 10%, P<0.05) and very-low-density lipoprotein triacylglycerol 33 vs 9%, P<0.01). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and factor VII (fVII) levels decreased more during consumption of oat bran compared with the control period (PAI-1: 30 vs 2.3%, P<0.01; fVII: 15 vs 7.6%, <0.001). Fecal volume and dry matter were greater when consuming the oat bran diet compared with the control (P<0.001), and energy excretion was increased by 37% (1014 vs 638 kJ/day, P<0.001); however, changes in body weight did not differ (oat bran: -0.3 +/- 0.5 kg; control: 0.0 +/- 0.7 kg). Conclusions: Addition of oat bran (6 g soluble fiber/day) to a low-fiber diet lowered total and non-HDL cholesterol, as well as hemostatic factors, and may affect energy balance through reduced energy utilization.

"The effectiveness of thymol as an antimicrobial agent during the determination of equilibrium moisture sorption data at high-water activities (0.50-0.98) was studied at 5, 23, and 45 A degrees C in oat flour. The static gravimetric (SG) method (with and without added thymol) and the dynamic vapor sorption technique (DVS) were used. Microbial growth in samples conditioned in these environments at temperatures of 5 and 45 A degrees C was null indicating no need for the use of thymol at these temperatures. However, samples confined in environments kept at 23 A degrees C, when the SG method was used, needed addition of thymol since mold growth took place in its absence. The statistical comparison between experimental equilibrium moisture content (EMC) mean values showed that, at 45 A degrees C, EMC values obtained using the SG technique with added thymol were significantly higher than those obtained without thymol by both SG and DVS techniques. This could indicate an interaction of thymol with food components or absorption by lipids present. Therefore, caution must be exerted when using thymol as an antimicrobial agent at elevated temperatures and high equilibrium relative humidity. Moisture adsorption isotherms for oat flour were determined using a DVS technique and no isotherm crossover with temperature, as previously reported for this product using thymol as an antimicrobial agent, was exhibited. Moisture sorption data obtained in this work by DVS can be considered more accurate than those previously reported for oat flour, since no external agent was involved during isotherm determinations.",665,99,99,1,99,0,1,0,1,3,250
"The extraction capacity of several solvent mixtures and comparison between alkaline and acid hydrolysis to extract free and bound minor polar compounds in oat samples were carried out. The extraction yield of each method was evaluated by correlating several spectrophotometric indices (absorption at 320 nm and total phenolic compounds by the Folin-Ciocalteu method) with HPLC-MS and the antioxidant activities of the oat extracts (DPPH radical method). The results showed that methanol and alkaline hydrolysis reported the highest recovery of polar compounds, and spectrophotometric indices over-estimated the content of these compounds. Antioxidant compounds of five Romanian oat samples, named Comun, Jeremy, Mures, Lovrin 1, Lovrin 27-T were determined. Large intervarietal differences in phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activities among oat varieties were detected. Total minor polar contents content was in the range of 1179.47 and 1897.18 mg/kg of seed. According to the literature, we found that the majority of the minor polar compounds existed in bound form.

"Background and aims: Dietary fibre (DF) may play an important role in weight control. The amount, type and way of processing of DF modify food structure and subsequent postprandial appetitive, metabolic and hormonal effects, but current understanding about the magnitude of effects that specific types and amounts of DF exert are still poorly understood. Methods and results: We investigated the effects of wheat and oat brans alone and as combination in semisolid food matrix on postprandial appetite profile and gastrointestinal (GI) hormonal responses. Twenty healthy, normal-weight subjects (5 male/15 female, aged 23.3 +/- 0.85y) participated in the study. Isoenergetic and isovolumic (1250 kJ, 300 g) puddings with different insoluble and soluble DF content were tested in a randomised order: pudding with 1) no added fibre, 2) 10 g wheat bran DF, 3) 10 g oat bran DF and 4) combination including 5 g wheat bran DF + 5 g oat bran DF. Blood samples were drawn before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after the test meals to determine plasma glucose, ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY) and serum insulin concentrations. Subjective profiles of appetite were assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS). Plasma glucose (P = 0.001) and serum insulin (P < 0.001) responses were the lowest after the pudding with the greatest amount of beta-glucan. In contrast, postprandial ghrelin or PYY responses or appetite sensations did not differ among the meals. Conclusion: Oat beta-glucan decreased postprandial plasma glucose and serum insulin responses, yet had no significant effects on GI peptide responses or appetite ratings. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Oat products are abundant in beta-glucan, which could lower the glycemic index of products or foods. A low glycemic index is beneficial in the control of postprandial glycemia. The study examined the hypoglycemic effects of oat products that had the same percentage of oat beta-glucan and were added into the diet fed to streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice for 6 weeks, and potential mechanisms are discussed here. Oat products significantly decreased fasting blood glucose and glycosylated serum protein (p < 0.05), but the hypoglycemic effect was not more than that of metformin (p > 0.05). Oat products increased glycogen, hormone, and nuclear receptor levels (p < 0.05), decreased free fatty acid content and succinate dehydrogenase activity (p < 0.05), and inhibited pancreatic apoptosis (p < 0.05).

"Effects of a Trichoderma reesei tyrosinase (TYR) and a Trametes hirsuta laccase (LAC) on breadmaking performance of gluten-free oat flour were investigated by SDS-PAGE analysis of oat protein fractions, large deformation rheology, and microscopy of the doughs, as well as on the basis of specific volume and firmness of the gluten-free breads. TYR induced the formation of higher molecular weight proteins in the SDS-PAGE assay. Microscopical analysis showed more intensive protein aggregation in the TYR-treated dough than in the dough without TYR. TYR also increased the firmness of the dough, which was assumed to be because of the cross-linking of oat globulins. LAC did not affect the oat globulins. TYR alone, or together with a commercial Thermomyces lanuginosus xylanase (XYL), increased significantly the specific volume of the gluten-free oat bread. A combination of TYR and XYL also increased the softness of the bread, whereas a combination of LAC and XYL improved the specific volume but did not affect the softness of oat bread. The results thus indicate that cross-linking of oat globulins by TYR, especially with the addition of XYL, was beneficial for improving the texture of gluten-free oat bread.",669,99,1,99,0,1,2,0,1,2,190
"Oats produce a group of phenolic antioxidants termed avenanthramides. These metabolites are, among food crops, unique to oats and have shown, in experimental systems, certain desirable nutritional characteristics such as inhibiting atherosclerotic plaque formation and reducing inflammation. Avenanthramides occur in both the leaves and grain of oat. In the leaves they are expressed as phytoalexins in response to crown rust (Puccina coronata) infection. The experiments reported here demonstrate that avenanthramide levels in vegetative tissue can be enhanced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), an agrochemical formulated to elicit systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The response to BTH was dramatically stronger than those produced with salicylic acid treatment. The roots of BTH treated plants also showed a smaller but distinct increase in avenanthramides. The dynamics of the root avenanthramide increase was substantially slower than that observed in the leaves, suggesting that avenanthramides might be transported from the leaves.",670,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,145
"Whole-plant response of two suspected resistant Avena fatua biotypes from Chile and Mexico to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides [aryloxyphenoxypropionate (APP), cyclohexanedione (CHD), and pinoxaden (PPZ)] and the mechanism behind their resistance were studied. Both dose-response and ACCase enzyme activity assays revealed cross-resistance to the three herbicide families in the biotype from Chile. On the other hand, the wild oat biotype from Mexico exhibited resistance to the APP herbicides and cross resistance to the CHD herbicides, but no resistance to PPZ. Differences in susceptibility between the two biotypes were unrelated to absorption, translocation, and metabolism of the herbicides. PCR generated fragments of the ACCase CT domain spanning the potential mutations sited in the resistant and susceptible biotypes were sequenced and compared. A point mutation was detected in the aspartic acid triplet at the amino acid position 2078 in the Chilean biotype and in isoleucine at the amino acid position 2041 in the Mexican wild oat biotype, which resulted in a glycine triplet and an asparagine triplet, respectively. On the basis of in vitro assays, the target enzyme (ACCase) in these resistant biotypes contains a herbicide-insensitive form.

") is dependent on the source of exogenous proteins in the oat dough. By adding 1.0% (w/w, POB) TGase, the cooking qualities of the resulting noodles (i.e., those containing VWG and EA) were significantly elevated with lower cooking loss; the elasticity of both types of noodles increased. The effects of TGase in different dough systems were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In oat dough prepared with VWG, TGase was shown to catalyse the cross-linking of both oat protein and gluten protein; however, oat protein acted as the only substrate of TGase in the noodles that had been prepared with EA.

"Effects of lipid removal on the fine milling and air classification processing of oats were studied. Lipid removal by supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction enabled concentration of the main components of oats starch, protein, lipids and cell walls - into specific fractions. Using defatted oats as raw material, the highest beta-glucan concentration of the cell wall-enriched fraction was 33.9% as compared to 17.1% without lipid removal. This was probably due to more efficient milling yielding smaller particles, and release of starchy material from cellular structures during milling of defatted oats, resulting in better classification. The removal of lipids also enabled separation of an oat protein concentrate with a protein concentration of 73.0% and a mass yield of 5.0%. A trial with 2310 kg of oat groats showed that the process based on defatting and dry fractionation was also industrially applicable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Oat beta-glucan has been shown to have cholesterol, insulin and glucose lowering effects, which are related to increased viscosity of the intestinal contents. Some important factors influencing the viscosity are molecular weight, structure and concentration. To study the effect of variety and environment on beta-glucan content and molecular weight of beta-glucan, four oat varieties were grown in 11 different environments (location x year combinations) in a field experiment. The beta-glucan content varied between 2.3 and 3.2% and the average molecular weight of beta-glucan between 1.73 and 2.02 x 10(6) g mol(-1). There was a significant difference between varieties and environments for both beta-glucan content and molecular weight of beta-glucan. The effect of environment was much greater on molecular weight (71%) than on beta-glucan content (42%), while the effect of variety was greater on beta-glucan content (23%) than on molecular weight (4%). There was also a positive significant correlation between beta-glucan content and molecular weight of beta-glucan (p < 0.001, r = 0.46). These results show that beta-glucan content is a better target for plant breeding than molecular weight. However, both factors are important for the physiological effects of beta-glucan, and selection for high beta-glucan content will probably also give higher molecular weight. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"This study tested the effects of (1 -> 3),(1 -> 4) beta-D-glucan from oats, on activation of the guthypothalamic (PYY3-36-NPY) axis, satiety, and weight loss in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. DIO mice were fed standard lab chow diets or varied doses of beta-glucan for 6 weeks. Energy intake, satiety, body weight changes and peptide Y-Y3-36 (PYY3-36) were measured together with a satiety test and measurement of neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA expression in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc). The average energy intake (-13%, p<0.05) and body weight gain was lower with increasing beta-glucan over 6 wk with acute suppression of energy intake over 4 h. The highest beta-glucan diet significantly increased plasma PYY3-36, with suppression of Arc NPY mRNA.",676,-1,1,0,1,99,2,1,1,1,118
"Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the small intestinal mucosa. The causative agents have been identified as gluten proteins from wheat, barley, and rye, and the only available treatment for CD patients is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Non-gluten containing cereals would be a valuable contribution to the gluten-free diet. In this respect, oats are a good choice. However, commercial lots of oat flakes and flour frequently are contaminated with wheat, barley, and rye, and two studies have reported that some peptides derived from the gluten-like avenin storage proteins of oat can trigger an immune response in some CD patients. In the present study we have initiated the investigation whether all oat varieties contain similar amounts of potentially harmful sequences by biochemical and immunological methods. We confirm that commercial oat preparations are contaminated with other cereals that contain gluten or gluten-like proteins. Moreover, our results demonstrate that contamination-free oat varieties differ in their capacity to stimulate an avenin-sensitive gamma-gliadin specific T cell line derived from a patient with CD, indicative for differences in the two known avenin epitopes among oat varieties, implying that selection and breeding of completely, safe oat varieties for all CD patients may be a realistic possibility.

"Extrusion processing is a thermal process applied to food preparation. However, its effects on food ingredients are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of extrusion processing on soluble dietary fiber (SDF) in oat bran. The yield, composition, thermal properties, rheological behavior and functionality of SDF in extruded oat bran were compared with those of SDF in untreated oat bran. The results showed that SDF in extrude oat bran had higher yields (14.2%), mean particle diameter (1718.1 nm), peak temperature (T(p) = 69.0 degrees C), solubility, swelling capacity, solvent retention capacity, foam ability, apparent viscosity and consistency coefficient, and lower flow behavior index than those of SDF in untreated oat bran. The extrusion process improves some properties of SDF from oat bran. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",678,1,1,1,0,99,3,0,1,1,133
"Coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic intolerance to gluten, contained mainly in wheat, rye and barley. The only therapy at present is the lifelong exclusion of gluten from the diet. Whether oats can be considered safe for CD patients has long been debated, and oats have been included among gluten-free ingredients only recently (EU Regulation 41/2009), provided the gluten content does not exceed 20 ppm. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of 36 different oat cultivars for CD patients using biochemical and immunochemical approaches. The cross-reactivity between avenins and gliadins was evaluated by both SDS-PAGE/Immunoblotting and ELISA. The protein pattern of each oat cultivar showed both qualitative and quantitative differences that correlated with different binding affinity for specific anti-gliadin antibodies in immunoblotting. In most oat samples, the content of cross-reactive proteins measured by ELISA was below 20 ppm, but in a few varieties was above 80 ppm. Although the taxonomic and biochemical characteristics of oats allow to conclude that their use could be safe for CD patients, it is essential to select those cultivars having the lowest level of gluten-like proteins.

"Background: Pure oats are safe for most patients with celiac disease, but concerns regarding contamination by other grains limit their consumption. The Canadian Celiac Association recently released guidelines governing the production of pure oats. The objective was to test the safety of a product manufactured under these guidelines. Methods: Fifteen adults with established, biopsy-confirmed celiac disease of >= 1 year duration were challenged with 350 g/wk of pure oats for 12 weeks. Symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, albumin, and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) were assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12. Duodenal biopsies were obtained before and after oat challenge and assessed based on the modified Marsh-Oberhuber score. Compliance with a gluten-free diet was monitored with random food diaries. Results: Fifteen patients completed the study and were analyzed in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. There were no significant changes in symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, or albumin during oat consumption. The tTG remained negative in all patients, and the histology scores did not significantly change during oat challenge. The only relapse occurred in a patient who became noncompliant with her gluten-free diet. Conclusion: The findings support the safety of pure, uncontaminated oats manufactured under Canadian Celiac Association guidelines for patients with celiac disease.

"This study determined the bioavailability of selenium (Se) from yellow peas and oats harvested from the high-Se soil of South Dakota, United States. The Se concentrations were 13.5 +/- 0.2 and 2.5 +/- 0.1 mg/kg (dry weight) for peas and oats, respectively. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were depleted of Se by feeding them a 30% Torula yeast-based diet (4.1 mu g Se/kg) for 56 days, and then they were replenished with Se for an additional 50 days by feeding them the same diet supplemented with 20, 30, or 40 mu g Se/kg from peas or oats, respectively. Selenium bioavailability was determined on the basis of the restoration of Se-dependent enzyme activities and tissue Se concentrations in Se-depleted rats, comparing those responses for yellow peas and oats to those for L-selenomethionine (SeMet; used as a reference) by using a slope-ratio method. Dietary supplementation with peas or oats resulted in linear or log-linear, dose-dependent increases in glutathione peroxidase activities in blood and liver and in thioredoxin reductase activity in liver. Supplementation with peas or oats resulted in linear or log-linear, dose-dependent increases in Se concentrations of plasma, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and kidneys. The overall bioavailability was approximately 88% for Se from yellow peas and 92% from oats, compared to SeMet. It was concluded that Se from naturally produced high-Se yellow peas or oats is highly bioavailable in this model and that these high-Se foods may be a good dietary source of Se.",681,0,1,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,240
"Chicken kofta prepared by using minced meat (72%) and optimized quantities of oat flour (8%), casein (2.5%) and refined wheat flour (7%), was treated as experimental product (OFC). The product containing refined wheat flour (10%), hydrogenated fat (7.5%) and without oat flour and casein was treated as control. The steam cooked kofta was sealed with air or nitrogen gas and stored at 4 +/- 2C for 15 days. Inclusion of oat flour and casein resulted in higher (P < 0.05) yield and lower fat (P < 0.05) in OFC as compared with control. The OFC samples were harder, gummy, cohesive and chewy compared with control. Casein and oat flour were inhibitory toward oxidation in kofta. Changes in Hunter color (L, a, b, hue and chroma) were marginal. The kofta containing oat flour and casein had better inhibition of oxymyoglobin oxidation. The nitrogen-product was microbiologically safe and sensorily acceptable during the 15 days of storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS There has been an increasing demand for foods with health-enhancing properties such as high-fiber and low-fat meat products. Consumers have always an upper hand in selection of a food processed with all natural food ingredients. Milk protein, casein, carrageenan and oat flour have been added to a variety of meat products in attempts to offset the detrimental effects of reducing the fat level and oxidation processes. Casein exhibits better functional properties and carrageenan has proven to be useful as fat replacer. Also, they are important for their gelation characteristics, their high water and fat- binding abilities and effect on emulsion stability. Whereas, oat flour has been proved to increase the fiber levels in meat products and retains the natural flavor of meat. In addition, casein and oat flour acts as natural antioxidants. Hence, it would provide a synergistic effect as a fat replacer and as natural antioxidants in product development.",682,99,99,1,99,1,2,0,0,3,306
"Fractionation of chemical species of phosphorus, manganese, iron, nickel, copper, zinc and molybdenum in rye and oat flakes and porridge made of oat flakes was studied by size exclusion chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The effect of in vitro simulated digestion of the samples was elucidated by comparison of the digestates and the extracts of the samples (in the Tris-HCl buffer solution, pH = 7.5). The procedure of simulated digestion included two steps: the pepsin-catalysed hydrolysis in diluted hydrochloric acid (pH = 1.7) followed by the pancreatin-catalysed hydrolysis at pH = 7.5. The enzyme-catalysed digestion of the samples results in alteration of iron, copper and zinc species distribution. The species of phosphorus in original cereal samples are distributed between two fractions: a medium-molecular mass fraction (15 kDa) and a low-molecular mass fraction (2 kDa). This pattern is also kept basically in the sample digestates. In digested samples, the majority of soluble iron is bound in a medium-molecular mass fraction (20 kDa), while in the extracts only traces of iron were found in a high-molecular mass fraction. Approximately 90% of the soluble zinc in the digestates of cereal flakes is represented by non-bound zinc ions. The bound zinc is mostly concentrated in a low-molecular mass fraction (1-2 kDa) together with some copper and almost all nickel. The low-molecular mass fractions (1-2 kDa) of nickel, copper and zinc present in extracts of original samples correspond quite well to those in the respective digestates. Molybdenum species occurs in another low-molecular mass fraction.",683,99,1,0,0,99,1,0,2,2,252
"The objective of this study was to develop an oil in water (o/w) emulsion using modified oat bran (MOB). Test emulsions containing 5% rapeseed oil were prepared by varying the content of MOB and maintaining the solid content constant (20%) by using corn syrup solids (DE34) as filler. A central composite (CC) design was applied as a tool to obtain a stable and low viscosity emulsion. The effect of concentration of MOB, homogenization pressure and homogenization time on the emulsion stability (at 25 degrees C for 26 h), viscosity and particle size were determined. The concentration of MOB in the recipe significantly influenced the emulsion properties whereas the homogenization pressure and the homogenization time had no statistically significant influence on the emulsion properties. Further experiments, however, showed that increasing the homogenization pressure decreased the emulsion viscosity. Emulsions prepared using a MOB concentration of 1.55% and homogenized at 60 MPa for 10 min, exhibited excellent stability, low viscosity, small enough mean particle size and narrow particle size distribution. Modified oat bran containing deamidated oat protein possesses an excellent capability to form stable emulsions which might be suitable for microencapsulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background: in traditional medicine, blueberries have been used to facilitate blood glucose regulation in type 2 diabetes. Recent studies in diabetic mice have indicated facilitated glycaemic regulation following dietary supplementation with extracts from European blueberries, also called bilberries, (Vaccinium myrtillus). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of fermented oat meal drinks containing bilberries or rosehip (Rosa canina) on glycaemic and insulinaemic responses. Methods: glycaemic and insulinaemic responses in young healthy adults were measured in two series. In series 1, two drinks based on oat meal (5%), fermented using Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, and added with fruit (10%); bilberries (BFOMD) or rose hip (RFOMD) respectively, were studied. In series 2, BFOMD was repeated, additionally, a drink enriched with bilberries (47%) was tested (BBFOMD). As control a fermented oat meal drink (FOMD) was served. Results: in series 1 the bilberry-and rosehip drinks, gave high glucose responses similar to that after the reference bread. However, the insulin index (II) after the BFOMD was significantly lower (II = 65) (P < 0.05). In series 2 a favourably low insulin demand to BFOMD was confirmed. FOMD gave high glucose response (GI = 95) but, significantly lower insulin response (II = 76). BBFOMD gave remarkably low insulin response II = 49, and tended to lower glycaemia (GI = 79) (P = 0.0684). Conclusion: a fermented oat meal drink added with bilberries induced a lower insulin response than expected from the glycaemic response. The mechanism for the lowered acute insulin demand is still unclear, but may be related to some bio-active component present in the bilberries, or to the fermented oat meal base.",685,1,1,1,-1,0,3,1,1,0,270
"A rapid accurate and precise method for simultaneous determination of beta-glucan and protein content in naked oat samples, based on the coupling of near-infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics, is presented. In particular, three different spectroscopic approaches [near infrared reflectance (NIR) and transmittance (NIT) on flour and NIT on whole grains] and various spectral pretreatments were considered. To account for the possibility of outlying samples, a robust version of the PLS algorithm (namely partial robust M-regression) was used. All the models resulted as accurate as the reference methods, reflectance spectroscopy being the technique providing the best outcomes. Variable reduction by inclusion of the most relevant predictors only (as evaluated by VIP scores) resulted in simpler and, in one case, more parsimonious models, without loss in accuracy.",686,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,124
"Whole grain oats are widely regarded as conferring significant health benefits. Composite flour of whole grain oat flour, wheat flour, and tapioca starch in the ratio 1:1:0.16 was formulated to make oat noodles with the addition of gluten at various levels. The influence of gluten on pasting and gelling properties of composite flour, and on cooking, textural, and sensory properties of salted oat noodles was evaluated. Addition of gluten decreased the paste viscosity, reduced hardness and springiness of gel, reduced cooking yield, cooking loss, and broken ratio during cooking, and increased the tensile strength and firmness of cooked noodles. Scanning electron microscopy showed that gluten tightened the network of protein in the noodles by forming oriented fibrils. Addition of gluten had little effect on the color of raw and cooked oat noodles, which were somewhat yellow. Sensory evaluation indicated that addition of gluten could enhance the overall acceptability of cooked oat noodles. This study may stimulate further interest in using functional whole grain cereal ingredients in developing healthy staple foods.",687,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,170
"Changes in fats extracted from cookies stored for three or five weeks and containing different levels of oat flakes (10, 20, 30%) were investigated. The fats used for baking differed in fatty acid (FA) composition and contained 17.6-57.6% saturated (SFA), 0.8-46.8% trans FA (TFA), and 0.6-6.6% polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). Oat flakes were steam stabilized and were in the middle of their shelf-life. Oat flakes contained 9.5% lipids in which linoleic acid (C 18:2 9c 12c) predominated, amounting to 42.7%. Increasing the content of oat flakes and the storage time of cookies resulted in increased values of primary and secondary fat oxidation products. Highest increases in PV values were found in cookies stored for three or five weeks, especially with a high content of oat flakes (30%). Secondary lipid oxidation products measured by AnV values increased with the time of storage. Highest increases in hydrolytic and oxidation products were associated with higher content (6.6%) of PUFA in utilized fats. Regarding the degree of oxidation, it appears safe to add as much as 30% of oat flakes to cookies when the storage time does not exceed three weeks.",688,99,99,0,1,99,1,0,1,3,186
"The baking properties of oats are poor, mainly due to the lack of gluten matrix and hence the surface properties of the aqueous phase are crucial for the gas retention in oat dough. Our aim was to study the composition and foaming properties of the water-soluble fraction from differently processed oats. A water extract from kilned oats contained nonpolar triglycerides and had poor foaming properties, whereas removing lipids with hexane extraction improved the foaming capacity and foam stability. A water extract from supercritical carbon dioxide extracted oats (CO(2)-oats) was free from nonpolar lipids and had good foam stability and excellent foaming capacity. Moreover, oat lipid-binding proteins, tryptophanins, were highly concentrated in the CO(2)-oats-derived foam and apparently played an important role in the foam structure. Supplementing CO(2)-oats extract with small quantities (<0.05%) of nonpolar lipids of oats destructed its foaming properties. In a preliminary baking trial, the addition of the nonpolar lipids to CO(2)-oats and wheat-starch-based baking recipes resulted in baked goods with reduced volume. The study showed that nonpolar triglycerides were present in the aqueous phase of oat in a quantity that impaired foaming. Moreover, this was the first study showing that tryptophanins, lipid-binding proteins of oats, were highly concentrated in foams prepared of oats free of water-extractable nonpolar lipids. In conclusion, tryptophanins can be considered as the foam-active proteins of oats that prevent the lipid-induced destabilization of foam structures which could improve the baking properties of oats.",689,-1,0,1,0,99,1,1,2,1,238
"Extrusion cooking is a food processing technique that is used worldwide to transform various ingredients. The aim of this work was to apply extrusion to develop a functional puffed ingredient with defatted soy flour and oat bran and the minimum amount of corn starch required to attain good textural properties. The proportions of the feed ingredients and the processing conditions (extruder temperature, moisture, and inulin percentage as a technological coadjutant) were optimized. Applying mixture experimental design to study the effect of feed ingredients on expansion and textural properties of extruded product, the formula containing 250 g/kg corn starch, 375 g/kg soy flour, and 375 g/kg oat bran was selected as the best between tested. Using this blend and applying incomplete factorial design, the best process conditions (250 g/kg moisture; 45 g/kg inulin and 130 degrees C) were chosen. Based on the results of the process, optimization step temperatures higher than 130 degrees C were tested and showed that 160 degrees C increased the radial expansion ratio and decreased hardness the most. The obtained puffed product had 212.6 g/kg fiber, 281.0 g/kg protein, and a caloric value of 319.1 kcal/100 g.

"Autoclaved oats were inoculated with a strain of Fusarium sporotrichioides or Fusarium poae. Moisture content of oats after inoculation was at 38%, incubation took place in standing culture at 28 degrees C. The A-type trichothecenes, 4,15-diacetoxyscirpenol (4,15-DAS), 15-monoacetoxyscirpenol (15-MAS), and scirpentriol (SCIRP) were analyzed by GC/MS. For each strain, three culture flasks were harvested at 2-3 day intervals starting immediately after inoculation. Total incubation time was 42 days (F. poae) and 56 days (F. sporotrichioides). Following peak accumulation, 4,15-DAS decreased below the detection limit for both strains, 15-MAS decreased below this limit for the isolate of F. sporotrichioides, for the isolate of F. poae it decreased to a level markedly below the peak value. SCIRP, after having peaked, decreased to some extent for the strain F. sporotrichioides, with a significant (P = 0.0029) negative linear regression of toxin content against culture age during this period. The content of 15-MAS, and in part also of 4,15-DAS, decreased along with an increase of SCIRP. This sequential accumulation pattern suggests the successive induction of esterases deacetylating 4,15-DAS and 15-MAS, as well as of enzymes involved in the metabolization of the parent alcohol, SCIRP. The results may explain, at least in part, the somewhat higher incidence in naturally contaminated compounds reported in the literature for SCIRP compared to 4,15-DAS and 15-MAS.",691,1,99,-1,1,99,2,1,0,2,217
"BACKGROUND: Multicereal/pseudocereal blends based on major and minor seeds with high nutritional profile appear as a promising strategy, hardly explored, to obtain enhanced value grain-based foods such as bread. RESULTS: In a preliminary stage the suitability of minor/ancient cereals (rye, oat, Kamut (R) wheat, spelt wheat) and pseudocereals (buckwheat) was assessed in single (100% of wheat flour replacement) and multigrain (from 20 to 44% of wheat flour replacement) matrices. The research allowed identification of the qualitative (oat, rye, buckwheat) and quantitative (up to 75% of wheat flour replacement) grains in the mixed matrices providing enhancement of nutritional quality (higher protein content, higher mineral content, lower digestible starch, higher viscous fibre content, higher resistant starch content, source of antioxidants) and minimisation of techno-functional impairment and sensory depreciation of the resulting breads. CONCLUSION: The quality profile of associated mixtures of oat, rye, buckwheat and common wheat flours (20 : 20 : 20 : 40 w/w/w/w) endorsed the proposed grain blend as suitable to make highly nutritious, modern and innovative baked goods meeting functional and sensory standards in terms of nutritional added value (improved dietary fibre fractions, minerals and antioxidant activity, slower starch hydrolysis), palatability (high sensory scores), convenience (extended keepability during storage) and easy handling during processing.

"Oat is a promising forage crop in arid northern China where increased land degradation and shortage of forage resources for animal production during winter have accentuated the need for alternative forage crops. Our objective was to determine the growth, biomass production, grain yield and quality of oat (Avena saliva L.) using different rates (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg ha(-1)) of superabsorbent polymer in northern China. Baiyan 7 (B7), a forage producing hulled oat was cultivated for two seasons (early, with limited irrigation and late, under rain-fed conditions) in the year 2008. Total precipitation was 278.5 mm during the early season (1(st) May to 31(st) July) and only 156.2 mm in the late season (11(th) July to 12(th) October). The above-ground biomass increased significantly in both early (87.3%) and late (54.1%) season crops with the application of superabsorbent polymer at 60 kg he. The below-ground biomass, grain yield, number of panicles and tiller fertility rates as well as relative water content, crude protein content and relative feed value were also increased. The optimum application rate of the superabsorbent polymer in the study area was 60 kg ha(-1); other rates were neither sufficient nor economical. Forage quantity and quality differed little with season.

Noodles were evaluated in terms of cooking quality, color, chemical, and sensory properties. As oat flour level increased, protein, crude fat, ash, Mn, Fe, Zn, and Mg contents of noodles increased. Oat flour caused increases in cooking loss of noodles. Sensory and cooking characteristics of noodles were negatively effected when oat flour level was increased compared with the control. Noodle with 10% oat flour received the highest sensory scores in all noodle samples containing oat flour. Overall acceptability scores of control and in only the noodle with 10% oat flour were found statistically (p < 0.05) similar.

"The aim of this work was to study the effects of sourdough fermentation of wheat flour with Lactobacillus plantarum, on the quality attributes of mixed oat-wheat bread (51 g whole grain oat flour and 49 g/100 g white wheat flour). Emphasis was laid both on beta-glucan stability as well as bread structure and sensory quality. The variables of the sourdough process were: dough yield (DY), fermentation time, fermentation temperature, and amount of sourdough added to the bread dough. The sourdough process was shown to be a feasible method for mixed oat-wheat bread, and, when optimized, provided bread quality equal to straight dough baking. A small amount (10g/100 g dough) of slack sourdough fermented at high temperature for a long time resulted in the most optimal sourdough bread with the highest specific volume (3.5 cm(3)/g), the lowest firmness after 3 days storage (0.31 kg), and low sensory sourness with high intensity of the crumb flavour. Wheat sourdough parameters did not affect the content of oat beta-glucan in the bread. Additionally, both straight dough and sourdough bread contained 1.4-1.6 g beta-glucan/100 g fresh bread. The average molecular weight of beta-glucan was 5.5 x 10(5) in both types of bread, while that of oat flour was 10 x 10(5). This indicates that a slight degradation of beta-glucan occurred during proofing and baking, and it was not affected by variation in the acidity of the bread between pH 4.9-5.8.

"BACKGROUND: Drought stress significantly limits oat (Avena sativa L.) growth and productivity. Thus an efficient management of soil moisture and study of metabolic changes in response to drought are important for improved production of oat. The objective was to gain a better understanding of drought tolerance mechanisms and improve soil water management strategies using water-saving superabsorbent polymer (SAP) at 60 kg ha(-1) under three irrigation levels (adequate, moderate and deficit) using a new type of hydraulic pressure-controlled auto irrigator. RESULTS: The results showed that the relative water content and leaf water potential (psi(1)) were much higher in oats treated with SAP. Although the SAP had little effect on plant biomass accumulation under adequate and moderate irrigation, it significantly increased the biomass by 52.7% under deficit irrigation. Plants treated with SAP under deficit irrigation showed a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities in leaves compared with control plants. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that drought stress leads to production of oxygen radicals, which results in increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in the plant, and the application of SAP could conserve soil water, making same available to plants for increased biomass accumulation and reduced oxidative stress especially under severe water stress.

"beta-Glucan in oat is widely considered as the main ingredient for the anti-hypercholesterol effects; however, phenolic compounds in oat are also regarded to possess potential activities against dyslipidemia. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms thoroughly, it is of great significance to evaluate and compare the hypolipidemic properties exerted by oat phenol-rich extract (PE) and beta-glucan extract (GE) in hyperlipidemic ICR mice induced by high-fat diet. The study was conducted for 12 weeks. Both PE and GE showed a significant hypocholesterolemic action by reducing the concentration of serum total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol and hepatic TC. Only PE reduced the hepatic triacylglycerol (TG), inhibited hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary CoA reductase activities and improved the hepatic antioxidant defense system. However, GE significantly increased fecal excretion of neutral cholesterol and bile acids. This study demonstrated that not only beta-glucan but also oat phenolic acids contributed to a preventive effect on hyperlipidemia.

EBC beta-glucan had greater peak molecular weight than corresponding whole oat flour. Both whole oat flour and EBC from N979 and IA95 had greater peak viscosity (PV), as measured using a Rapid ViscoAnalyser, than that from Jim or Paul. Bile acid binding of EBC, correlated with total beta-glucan concentrations and PV, was either similar or greater than that of corresponding whole oat flour. Jim EBC had the least expansion ratio, lowest brown colour and cereal aroma but greatest tooth packing values. Paul and N979 EBC, although different from each other in a few sensory attributes, had similar acceptability as judged from a consumer test, suggesting that oats with elevated beta-glucan concentrations can be successfully incorporated into EBC with minimal processing alterations.",700,99,1,0,99,99,1,0,1,3,148
"Flour was obtained from oats fermented with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to study the effect of fermentation on the physical properties and the suitability of fermented oats for use in starch noodle production. The results showed that fermented samples had a significantly lower pH than control samples. Gel strength and amylose content initially increased and then decreased (P < 0.05) with fermentation time. The peak viscosity, breakdown, final viscosity, and setback value decreased with fermentation time. Fermented noodles showed a higher hardness and springiness. In particular, Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) induced the highest springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, and resilience over 12 hr of fermentation. The cooking quality evaluation indicated that fermentation improved the quality of oat starch noodles. Fermented oats resulted in noodles with low cooking loss and higher cooking weight compared to noodles made from fresh flour. The use of LP for 12 hr of fermentation time yielded noodles of the best quality.",701,1,99,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,153
"Bread represents a suitable food product for the addition of functional ingredients, such as the cholesterol-lowering dietary fibre oat beta-glucan and the prebiotic inulin. Therefore, these soluble fibres were incorporated into wheat as well as gluten-free bread, and their effects on rheological properties of the dough, on bread quality and on crumb microstructure were compared. The level of remaining beta-glucan as well as its molecular weight was determined using an enzyme kit and size-exclusion chromatography. The addition of oat beta-glucan resulted in a higher water addition level, whereas incorporation of inulin had the opposite effect. Rheological testing showed that the incorporation of oat beta-glucan results in a more elastic dough. The baking characteristics mainly affected by fibre addition were volume and crust colour, with inulin increasing and oat beta-glucan decreasing loaf-specific volume in the gluten-free breads. Inulin led to a darkening of the crust of both bread types, whereas addition of oat beta-glucan resulted in a lighter crust of gluten-free bread. Oat beta-glucan softened the crumb of gluten-free bread, but had the opposite effect on wheat bread. Inulin resulted in an increased crumb hardness as well as the rate of staling. Beta-glucan breakdown was more pronounced in wheat bread than in gluten-free bread. The results show that the use of beta-glucan to increase the nutritional value of wheat bread is limited due to negative influences on technological properties. However, this soluble fibre is highly suitable for incorporation into gluten-free bread.",703,1,1,99,1,1,4,0,0,1,240
"Oats (Avena sativa L) were extracted with 80% aqueous ethanol and the extract was successively isolated by liquid-liquid partition to yield n-hexane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water layers. Among them, the ethyl acetate (EA) layer exhibited the highest total phenolic content (TPC), the strongest DPPH radical-scavenging activity and an inhibitory effect on an oleic acid-induced (OA-induced) fatty liver model in vitro. Thus, it was further fractionated by a Sephadex LH-20 column into three subtractions (SF1-SF3). SF3 was the most active subfraction in all the assays above, the yield being 1.70% of the dry weight of the EA fraction. The major components in SF3 were identified as avenanthramides Bc, Bp and Bf by HPLC analysis, with contents of about 5.20%, 9.19% and 8.06% of the dry weight of SF3, respectively. Also, the avenanthramides Bc, Bp and Bf all had significant inhibitory effects on oleic acid-induced (OA-induced) fatty liver. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Oscillation and creep shear tests were applied to test the effect of fibre-rich additions - carob fibre (0-5%) and black oat wholemeal (0-20%) - on the rheological properties of wheat flour dough. Interpretation of changes in the values of the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G '') and the tangent of the phase angle (tan delta) in the function of oscillation frequency (f) was performed on the basis of proposed 3-parameter non-linear regression models. The results of creep measurements were analysed using the 6-parameter Burgers model. Increase in the share of the fibre-rich additions caused the G'(f) and G ''(f) curves to shift towards higher values, and steeper slope and stronger bending of the shapes of the curves, while the tan delta(f) curve tended to shift towards lower values. The application of carob fibre and oat wholemeal at rates of 2% and 10%, respectively, caused that the ratio of viscous to elastic properties of wheat flour dough was the least dependent on the shear rate (f). The result of creep tests showed an increase in the instantaneous and retarded moduli of elasticity and the Newtonian viscosity of wheat flour dough with increase in the share of the additions.

"Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) is a substituted cellulose that reduces serum cholesterol at modest intake levels. HPMC has also been used for decades in gluten-free breads at a level to optimize loaf volume. Because consumers resist the consumption of whole wheat breads, the sensory and physical properties of all oat and barley breads incorporating HPMC were evaluated. Oat and barley also contain beta-glucan, a glucose polymer similar to HPMC that also lowers cholesterol. The textural and sensory properties of the breads were determined by instrumental and chemical methods and sensory panels. HPMC increased the loaf volume of the breads by up to 2 times and decreased hardness immediately after baking and after up to 3 days of storage. Barley bread with HPMC was rated the highest in overall acceptability by sensory panelists compared to oat and wheat breads with or without HPMC.",706,1,1,1,99,99,3,0,0,2,141
"The present study was to characterize the avenanthramide-rich extract (ARE) from oat bran and assess its effect on activity and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes in D-galactose-induced oxidativestressed mice. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis found that ARE had 6.07% N-(3',4'-dihydroxycinnamoyl)-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (Bc), 4.37% N-(4'-hydroxycinnamoyl)-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (Bp), and 5.36% N-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxycinnamoyl)-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (Bf). In addition, ARE was also rich in vanillic acid (0.60%), caffeic acid (0.50%), syringic acid (0.54%), p-coumaric acid (0.16%), ferulic acid (0.08%), and sinapic acid (0.03%). Administration of D-galactose markedly lowered not only the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) but also the gene expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD), copper zinc SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA in mice. Administration of ARE significantly reversed the D-galactose-induced oxidative stress by increasing the activity of the antioxidant enzymes and upregulating their gene expression. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in mice given ARE compared to the control. The results demonstrated that ARE possessed the antioxidant activity and was effective against D-galactose-induced oxidative stress.",707,1,1,1,0,99,3,0,1,1,175
"Information on interactions between oat beta-glucan and tea polyphenols (TP) is not available in the published literatures. Equilibrium dialysis was applied to determine the adsorption of TP into beta-glucan, and response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the absorbing variables (pH, temperature, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer concentration). The equilibrium data at constant temperature were fitted with the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Redlich-Peterson models. The results showed that the Freundlich model was the best method to describe the experimental data. Parabolic curves were obtained for pH and temperature. In terms of adsorption capacity, factors including temperature, pH/temperature, and buffer concentration/temperature had the greatest influence on the response. The highest adsorption capacity of TP into beta-glucan was 134.55 mu g mg(-1) at the following optimized conditions: pH 5.56, PBS buffer concentration 0.13 M, and temperature 40 degrees C. No significant differences (p > 0.05) between the experimental and predicted values confirmed the adequacy of the response surface equations.",708,0,0,1,1,99,2,0,2,1,158

The treatments were: nitrogen rates (40, 100 kg . ha(-1)) and oat cultivars (dwarf lines: STH 6102 - naked, STH 735 - hulled and tall: Polar - naked, Krezus - hulled). The naked forms were characterised by a higher content of crude protein, ether extract, nitrogen free extract, and starch and a lower content of crude fibre and sugars in comparison with the hulled forms. Significant variation was found between the dwarf and the tall forms. The higher nitrogen treatment compared with the lower treatment resulted in an increase of crude protein and a decrease of: ether extract, nitrogen free extract, and starch.",709,99,99,1,-1,1,2,1,0,2,111
"Recently, the incidence of colon cancer has been rapidly increasing in previously low-risk countries other than the Western world. Since dietary factors are thought to be key components involved in high risk colon cancer, the current trend for colon cancer prevention is toward dietary intervention. To explore if whole oat functions as a chemoprevention agent, an inflammation-related mouse colon cancer model, initiated with 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), followed by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), was performed to evaluate the preventive effect of whole oat containing diets. The result indicated middle and high dose whole oat diets significantly reduced the number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) as well as colon tumors. Further, human colon carcinoma cells were subcutaneously inoculated into BALB/cAnNg-Foxn1 nude mice to measure the growth inhibition on whole oat diets. Low, middle and high dose whole oat diets significantly decreased the tumor volumes by 13%, 17% and 43%, respectively, indicating a dose dependent inhibitory effect. Meanwhile, 38% and 54% reductions in tumor weights were observed in middle and high dose whole oat diets. Together, the evidence suggests whole oat helps protect against colon cancer development and could be a good chemoprevention agent taken as a daily supplement. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"SUBARIC D., BABIC J., LALIC A., ACKAR D., KOPJAR M. (2011): Isolation and characterisation of starch from different barley and oat varieties. Czech J. Food Sci., 29: 354-360. Starches were isolated from three oat (Dzoker, Zvolen and Sampionka) and three barley (Barun, Zlatko and Vanessa) cultivars. The gelatinisation and retrogradation characteristics, pasting properties, swelling power, and solubility of the isolated starches were analysed. The gelatinisation onset temperatures varied from 59.4 degrees C to 61.4 degrees C for the oat starches (OS), and from 58.4 degrees C to 62.2 degrees C for the barley starches (BS). BS displayed a higher retrogradation enthalpy (Delta H-r) than OS after 7 and 14 days storage at 4 degrees C. OS-Sampionka had the lowest one while BS-Vanessa had the highest Delta H-r after 7 and 14 days of storage. Significant differences in pasting properties were observed between the OS and BS. OS showed higher values of maximum viscosity than BS and followed the order: OS-Dzoker > OS-Sampionka > OS-Zvolen > BS-Vanessa > BS-Zlatko > BS-Barun. The breakdown viscosities of BS were considerably lower than those of OS. OS had higher swelling power and solubility values than BS. The higher swelling and solubility values of the oat starches in conjunction with lower retrogradation suggest different applications of these starches. The results showed that, while the barley starches are suitable for such applications where high stability is needed during heating and shearing (low breakdown values), the oat starches have a great potential for the applications where high stability during storage is needed (low Hr values). In addition, the barley starches are suitable for those applications where high water binding is undesirable, while the oat starches are applicable where low amounts of starch need to bind high proportions of water.",712,99,99,99,99,-1,0,1,0,4,292
"A growing body of evidence suggests that a majority of people with celiac disease and on a gluten-free diet can safely consume pure oats in moderate amounts; however, previous studies have indicated that the commercial oat supply in other countries, and in Canada to some extent, is contaminated with other grains. This study has confirmed that the commercial oat supply in Canada is heavily contaminated with gluten from other grains. Approximately 88% of the oat samples (n = 133) were contaminated above 20mg kg(-1) and there were no differences between the oat types tested. Only one gluten-free variety of oats was analysed and it consistently provided negative results in all analyses. It is difficult to determine where the contamination originates, but there are possibilities for cross-contamination in the field, in the transport of the grain, in the storage of the grain, and in the milling and packaging facilities. It is clear from this study that only those products that have been certified 'pure' oats would be appropriate for a gluten-free diet.",714,1,0,1,1,-1,3,1,1,0,171

"Seven experimental oat lines with high (5.9% to 7.2%), medium (5.3% to 5.5%), and low (4.4%) beta-glucan concentrations were evaluated for the effects of beta-glucan molecular weight (MW) and structure on viscosities of oat-flour slurries. The MW of beta-glucans was determined by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. The structural features of beta-glucans were measured by using fluorophore-assisted capillary-electrophoresis after complete hydrolysis with lichenase. The oat-slurry viscosities were measured on a Rapid Visco Analyser under 4 conditions: (1) without starch (amylolysis, removal of starch by a-amylase); (2) without beta-glucan (removal of beta-glucan by lichenase); (3) natural action of enzymes (autolysis, in sodium buffer); and (4) inhibition of enzymes (in silver nitrate solution). Excluding one line (regression outlier), significant correlations (P < 0.05) between peak MW of beta-glucan and viscosities of oat slurries were obtained under inhibition. The ratio of degree of polymerization (DP) 3/DP4 negatively correlated with viscosity under amylolysis, autolysis, and inhibition (P < 0.05). The amount of DP >= 5 negatively correlated with pasting final viscosity after beta-glucan removal by lichenase (P < 0.05). Positive correlations (P < 0.05) between the ratio of beta-(1 -> 4)/beta-(1 -> 3) linkages and viscosities under autolysis and inhibition were found. Overall, these findings demonstrated that the peak MW, ratio of DP3/DP4, amount of DP >= 5, and ratio of beta-(1 -> 4)/beta-(1 -> 3) linkages of beta-glucans impacted pasting properties of oat-flour slurries.",717,99,99,0,1,99,1,0,1,3,230
"J. Inst. Brew. 117(3), 411-421, 2011 Oats are a cereal with beneficial nutritional properties and also unrealized brewing potential. Furthermore, oats can be tolerated by the majority of people who suffer from celiac disease. Malting of oats produced a malt, which was found suitable for brewing a 100% oat malt beer. The mashing regime, designed by using mathematical modelling, was successfully transferred to a pilot scale plant. The improved lautering performance of oat malt was due to its higher husk content, which also led to a lower extract content in oat wort when compared to barley won. The protein profile of oat wort, as measured by using Lab-on-a-Chip analysis, revealed that there was no significant difference in the protein profile between oat and barley wort. The fermentation of oat and barley worts followed the same trend; differences could only be seen in the higher pH and lower alcohol content of the oat beer. The flavour analysis of oat beer revealed some special characteristics such as a strong berry flavour and a lower amount of staling compounds when forced aged. This study revealed that it was possible to brew a 100% oat malt beer and that the produced beer was comparable to a barley malt beer.",718,99,1,1,-1,1,3,1,0,1,205
"Storage stability of oat groats processed commercially (conditioning with saturated steam followed by kiln drying) and with superheated steam (SS) was evaluated at room and elevated temperatures (21 and 38 degrees C, respectively) for 26 and 13 weeks, respectively. Monitoring of hexanal and free fatty acid levels, moisture content, colour, and cold paste (64 degrees C) viscosity, as well as sensory evaluation of groats were carried out during storage. Both the SS and the commercially processed groats remained shelf stable over the time periods tested. No substantial changes were noted in the colour, cold paste viscosity, and content of free fatty acids of differently heat processed groats as the storage time passed. Changes in the moisture content of stored groats reflected the seasonal changes in the humidity of the surroundings. At both storage temperatures, the amounts of hexanal released from groats processed either with SS or commercially increased with the increase of storage time. However, the groats processed with SS released lower amounts of hexanal than the groats processed commercially. As storage time progressed, both the SS and the commercially processed groats became blander, and it became increasingly difficult for sensory panellists to distinguish between groat samples from the different heat treatments.

"Oats and barley beta-glucans are well-known for their many health benefits; this has encouraged the food industry to develop new functional foods containing oats and barley. This study aims to develop an advanced sensitivity analysis to analyse and evaluate the most significant model inputs contributing to uncertainty in assessing the level of beta-glucan content in harvested oat and barley grains. Two methodologies, nominal value and regression method sensitivity analysis, were adopted. The nominal sensitivity analysis highlighted that cultivar selection is the predominant factor with a correlation coefficient 0.66 for hulled oats and barley cultivars, whereas the correlation was 0.80 and 0.77 for naked oats and hull-less barley, respectively. Advanced sensitivity analysis using regression modelling highlighted that cultivar selection, storage days and germination time (days) were the most important parameters in both the oats and barley model. Regression analysis using the response surface methodology shows that prediction models were found to be significant (P < 0.0001) with low standard errors and high coefficients of determination (R (2) > 0.94).

"Oxygenated fatty acids were identified in oat grain by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We hypothesized that most of these were the results of lipoxygenase activity. This hypothesis was tested by measuring concentrations of these compounds after hydrothermal treatments and storage of oat groats or oat flour for 22 weeks at 37 degrees C and 65% relative humidity. Steam treatments inactivated lipases, whereas roasting at 106 degrees C did not. Free fatty acids accumulated quickly in untreated or roasted flour, but not in steamed flour or groats. A total of six hydroxy and epoxy fatty acids were identified. Oxidized fatty acids were found in both esterified lipids and free fatty acids, indicating that lipase action was not necessary for lipid oxidation. More oxidation products were found in flour than in groats, and less were found in the steamed treatments. Lipoperoxygenase appeared to be involved in the formation of oxidation products, although nonenzymatic mechanisms may also operate. Hydroxy-fatty acids are associated with strongly bitter flavors and are undesirable.

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oat bran supplementation on time to exhaustion, glycogen stores and cytokines in rats submitted to training. The animals were divided into 3 groups: sedentary control group (C), an exercise group that received a control chow (EX) and an exercise group that received a chow supplemented with oat bran (EX-O). Exercised groups were submitted to an eight weeks swimming training protocol. In the last training session, the animals performed exercise to exhaustion, (e.g. incapable to continue the exercise). After the euthanasia of the animals, blood, muscle and hepatic tissue were collected. Plasma cytokines and corticosterone were evaluated. Glycogen concentrations was measured in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, and liver. Glycogen synthetase-alpha gene expression was evaluated in the soleus muscle. Statistical analysis was performed using a factorial ANOVA. Time to exhaustion of the EX-O group was 20% higher (515 +/- 3 minutes) when compared with EX group (425 +/- 3 minutes) (p = 0.034). For hepatic glycogen, the EX-O group had a 67% higher concentrations when compared with EX (p = 0.022). In the soleus muscle, EX-O group presented a 59.4% higher glycogen concentrations when compared with EX group (p = 0.021). TNF-alpha was decreased, IL-6, IL-10 and corticosterone increased after exercise, and EX-O presented lower levels of IL-6, IL-10 and corticosterone levels in comparison with EX group.

"Background: Consumption of 3 g oat beta-glucan/d is considered sufficient to lower serum LDL cholesterol, but some studies have shown no effect. LDL cholesterol lowering by oat beta-glucan may depend on viscosity, which is controlled by the molecular weight (MW) and amount of oat beta-glucan solubilized in the intestine (C). Objectives: Our 2 primary objectives were to determine whether consumption of 3 g high-MW oat beta-glucan/d would reduce LDL cholesterol and whether LDL cholesterol lowering was related to the log(MW x C) of oat beta-glucan. Design: In a double-blind, parallel-design, multicenter clinical trial, subjects with LDL cholesterol >= 3.0 and <= 5.0 mmol/L (n = 786 screened, n = 400 ineligible, n = 19 refused, n = 367 enrolled, and n = 345 completed) were randomly assigned to receive cereal containing wheat fiber (n = 87) or 3 g high-MW (2,210,000 g/mol, n = 86), 4 g medium-MW (850,000 g/mol, n = 67), 3 g medium-MW (530,000 g/mol, n = 64), or 4 g low-MW (210,000 g/mol, n = 63) oat beta-glucan/d (divided doses, twice daily) for 4 wk. Results: LDL cholesterol was significantly less with 3 g high-MW, 4 g medium-MW, and 3 g medium-MW oat beta-glucan cereals than with the wheat-fiber cereal by 0.21 (5.5%; 95% CI: -0.11, -0.30; P = 0.002), 0.26 (6.5%; 95% CI: -0.14, -0.37; P = 0.0007), and 0.19 (4.7%; 95% CI: -0.08, -0.30; P = 0.01) mmol/L, respectively. However, the effect of 4 g low-MW oat beta-glucan/d (0.10 mmol/L) was not significant (2.3%; 95% CI: 0.02, -0.20). By analysis of covariance, log(MW x C) was a significant determinant of LDL cholesterol (P = 0.003). Treatment effects were not significantly influenced by age, sex, study center, or baseline LDL cholesterol. Conclusions: The physicochemical properties of oat beta-glucan should be considered when assessing the cholesterol-lowering ability of oat-containing products; an extruded breakfast cereal containing 3 g oat beta-glucan/d with a high-MW (2,210,000 g/mol) or a medium-MW (530,000 g/mol) lowered LDL cholesterol similarly by approximate t",725,1,1,1,0,0,3,0,2,0,330
"Twenty bacteria isolated from three commercial oat bran products were tested for their folate production capability. The bacteria as well as some reference organisms were grown until early stationary phase on a rich medium (YPD), and the amount of total folate in the separated cell mass and the culture medium (supernatant) was determined by microbiological assay. Folate vitamer distribution was determined for eight bacteria including one isolated from rye flakes. For seven bacteria the effect of temperature and pH on folate production was studied in more detail. Relatively large amount of folate was both produced in the cell biomass (up to 20.8 mu g/g) and released to the culture medium (up to 0.38 mu g/g) by studied bacteria. The best producers were characterized as Bacillus subtilis ON4, Chryseobacterium sp. NR7, Janthinobacterium sp. RB4, Pantoea agglomerans ON2. and Pseudomonas sp ON8. The level of folate released in culture medium was the highest for B. subtilis ON5, Chryseobacterium sp. NR7, Curtobacterium sp. ON7, Enterococcus durans ON9, Janthinobacterium sp.

Marked differences in the distribution of folate vitamers among the bacterial strains were revealed by the HPLC analysis. The main vitamers were tetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Increase in the folate content during bacterial growth was accompanied by proportional increase in the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate content and decrease of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. 10-Formylfolic acid dominated in the culture media of four bacteria, and Janthinobacterium sp. RB4 was also found to excrete 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.

To accumulate GABA, samples from two different naked oat cultivars, Baiyan II and Bayou I, were steeped and germinated in an incubator. The content of GABA and glutamic acid as well as the activity of the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in oats during steeping and germination were investigated with an amino acid automatic analyzer. Compared with raw groats, an increase in GABA content of oat groats during steeping and germination was continuously observed for two oat cultivars. The activity of GAD increased greatly at the end of steeping and the second stage of germination for Baiyan II and Bayou I, respectively. Glutamic acid content of treated oat groats was significantly lower than that in raw groats until the later period of germination. GABA was correlated (p < 0.01) significantly and positively with the glutamic acid rather than GAD activity in the current study. The results indicates that steeping and germination process under highly controlled conditions can effectively accumulate the GABA in oat groats for Baiyan II and Bayou I, which would greatly facilitate production of nutraceuticals or food ingredients that enable consumers to gain greater access to the health benefits of oats. However, more assays need to be further performed with more oat cultivars.",727,1,1,1,99,0,3,0,1,1,226
"Oat (Avena sativa L.) kernels appear to contain much higher polar lipid concentrations than other plant tissues. We have extracted, identified, and quantified polar lipids from 18 oat genotypes grown in replicated plots in three environments to determine genotypic or environmental variation in these lipids. Validation experiments indicated a solid phase silica gel extraction step elution provided excellent and clean separation of extracted lipids into neutral lipid, glycolipid, and phospholipid fractions. Analysis of phospholipids by HPLC (normal phase, diol column) indicated phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and lyso- forms but very little genotypic or environmental variation. Di, tri and tetragalactosyl-diacylglycerols were quantified in the glycolipids, along with their mono-, di-, and tri-acyl estolides. Most of these exhibited significant genotypic variation. Molecular species analysis of the glycolipids in the Morton cultivar by direct infusion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the enormous diversity of galactosyl-lipids in oats. Analyses indicated total lipid of approximate to 8.3% (dry weight basis), of which approximate to 10% was phospholipid and 11% was glycolipids. These results indicate that oats are a rich source of polar lipids and contain an extremely rich diversity of galactosyl-lipids.",728,1,1,1,99,1,4,0,0,1,189
"The aim of this research was to identify endogenous bacteria in commercial oat bran and rye flake products in order to study their folate production capability while maintaining the soluble dietary fibre components in physiologically active, unhydrolyzed form. Fourty-two bacteria were isolated from three different oat bran products and 26 bacteria from one rye flake consumer product. The bacteria were tentatively identified by sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA genes. The identification results revealed up to 18 distinct bacterial species belonging to 13 genera in oat bran, and 11 species belonging to 10 genera in rye flakes. The most common bacterial genus in oat bran was Pantoea, followed by Acinetobacter, Bacillus, and Staphylococcus. Pantoea species dominated also in rye flakes. The extracellular enzymatic activities of the isolates were studied by substrate hydrolysis plate assays. Nearly 80% of the isolates hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose, whereas starch-degrading activities were surprisingly rare (10%). Beta-glucan was hydrolyzed by 19% of the isolates. Protease, lipase or xylanase activity was expressed by 24%, 29%, and 16%, respectively, of the isolates. Representatives of the genera Bacillus, Curtobacterium, Pedobacter, and Sanguibacter showed the highest diversity of enzymatic activities, whereas members of Jorithinobacterium and Staphylococcus possessed no hydrolytic activities for the substrates studied. Production capability for total folates was analyzed from aerobic cell cultures at the stationary growth phase. The amount of folates was determined separately for the cell mass and the supernatant by microbiological assay. For comparison, folate production was also examined in a number of common lactic acid bacteria. The best producers in oat bran belonged to the genera Bacillus, Janthinobacterium, Pantoea, and Pseudomonas, and those in rye flakes to Chryseobacteritim, Erwinia, Plantibacter, and Pseudomonas. Supernatant folate contents were high for Bacillus, Erwinia, Janthinobacterium, Pseudomo",729,0,99,0,1,99,1,0,2,2,286
"This study has examined the effect of water activity (a(w), 0.995-0.90) and temperature (10-37 degrees C) on the lag phases prior to growth, growth rates and used models to develop two dimensional profiles for optimum and marginal conditions for two strains of Fusarium langsethiae from four northern European countries (UK, Norway, Sweden, and Finland) on an oat-based medium. Results showed that the optimum a(w) for growth was at 0.98-0.995 and 25 degrees C. The limit for growth of the strains was at 0.92-0.93 a(w) with minima of 10 degrees C. No growth occurred at 37 degrees C. The lag phases prior to growth were lowest under optimum conditions and extended to >10 days at marginal conditions. Statistical analyses of intra and inter-strain differences in terms of both lag phases prior to growth and growth rates were not statistically significant. However, a(w) and temperature were statistically significant factors. Two dimensional profiles for strains from each country of origin were built to identify optimum and marginal conditions for F. langsethiae for the first time. These environmental profiles will be beneficial for improving the ecological knowledge of this species which is able to produce trichothecene mycotoxins in a range of temperate cereals.

"Net glucose and SCFA flux and insulin secretion into the portal vein might be associated with the incretins glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Our objectives were to clarify this association and study the impact of 2 doses of dietary oat beta-glucan on the variables. Three 35-kg portal vein-catheterized pigs were fed 3 diets containing 0, 3, or 6% oat beta-glucan concentrate (BGO, BG3, and 8G6) for 7 d in a repeated 3 x 3 Latin square. On d 7, blood was sampled for 12 h postprandially. Net glucose flux and apparent hormone production were calculated from plasma portal-arterial differences x flow. Postprandially, pigs fed BG6 had lower (P < 0.05) portal glucose at 15, 30, and 45 min and a lower (P < 0.05) net glucose flux during the first hour. Pigs fed BG6 tended to have lower (P < 0.10) portal C-peptide without lowering insulin, indicating that pigs fed BG6 had lower actual insulin release combined with a higher prehepatic retention of insulin. Pigs fed BG6 had lower (P < 0.05) portal GIP and GLP-1, which in turn were correlated (R-2 = 0.81 and 0.88, respectively; P < 0.01) with portal glucose. Pigs fed BG3 and BG6 had a higher (P < 0.05) net SCFA flux than pigs fed BGO, indicating increased fermentation. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of 6% oat beta-glucan concentrate decreased net glucose flux, increased net SCFA flux, and decreased peak apparent insulin production, changes that were associated with GIP and GLP-1 mediation.

"BACKGROUND: The present study focused on the antioxidant activities of aged oat (Avena sativa L.) vinegar. The antioxidant activities of oat and vinegar have been proved by many previous research studies. It should be noted that oat vinegar, as a novel seasoning, has antioxidant activity. RESULTS: Oat vinegar showed stronger radical scavenging activities, reducing power, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation than rice vinegar. The concentrations of polyphenols and flavonoids in oat vinegar were higher than those in rice vinegar. Ethyl acetate extract of oat vinegar possessed the most varieties of phenolic acids and showed the strongest antioxidant activity compared with ethanol and water extracts. At suitable doses of oat vinegar, the malondialdehyde value was decreased, activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were promoted, and hepatic damage induced by Co-60 gamma-irradiation was ameliorated in aging mice. CONCLUSION: Oat vinegar manifested antioxidant activity which was stronger than that of rice vinegar in vitro and the same as that of vitamin E in vivo.

"Seven experimental oat lines with high (6.2-7.2%), medium (5.5-5.9%), and low (4.4-5.3%) beta-glucan concentrations were evaluated for contributions of beta-glucan, starch, protein, and their interactions, to pasting properties of oat flours by using a Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA, Newport Scientific, Warriewood, NSW, Australia). Significant correlations (P < 0.05) between beta-glucan concentration and pasting parameters of oat slurries were obtained under autolysis without 1 h of incubation, inhibition, and amylolysis. The relative decrease of viscosity after enzymatic hydrolysis of beta-glucan correlated with beta-glucan concentration (P < 0.05). These data demonstrated the important contribution of beta-glucan to pasting. The relative decrease of viscosity after either amylolysis or enzymatic removal of protein correlated with beta-glucan concentration (P<0.1), which might be explained by the considerable contribution of the interaction of beta-glucan with starch and protein, to pasting. The viscosity decrease by hydrolysis of protein was much greater than the actual viscosity remaining after hydrolysis of both beta-glucan and starch, reconfirming the importance of interactions between protein and other oat components to pasting. Optimal multiple linear regression (MLR) models were generated to predict key pasting parameters in both buffer without 1 h of incubation and silver nitrate solution by using a stepwise procedure. The beta-glucan concentration alone or together with the concentration of starch, rather than protein, was selected as the predictor under certain conditions. These results illustrated the major unit contribution of beta-glucan, secondary unit contribution of starch, and minimal unit contribution of protein to pasting.",733,1,99,99,99,1,2,0,0,3,242
"The effects of added transglutaminase (TG) on the rheological and thermal properties of oat dough were evaluated. Mixolab, rheometer, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to analyse the oat dough for changes in thermomechanical, theological, and thermal properties. TG had distinct effects on dough water absorption, modified viscoelastic behaviour, and enhanced thermal stability. The dough also exhibited a decrease in the number of free amino groups after TG treatment, confirming protein cross-linking catalysed by TG. Electrophoresis of TG-treated oat protein fractions using SDS-PAGE, which was also used to analyse the effects of TG on the protein fractions of oat flour; it showed that both globulin and avenin were good substrates for TG.

"In the present study, we evaluated the cholesterol-lowering effects of different oat bran (OB) preparations, differing regarding their peak molecular weight (MW) of beta-glucans (2348, 1311, 241, 56, 21 or <10 kDa). in C57BL/6NCrl mice. The diets were designed to be atherogenic (0.8% cholesterol and 0.1 % cholic acid), and they reflected the Western diet pattern (41 % energy fat). All OB preparations that were investigated significantly reduced plasma cholesterol when compared with a cellulose-containing control diet, regardless of the molecular weight of beta-glucan. Moreover, the difference in viscous properties between the processed OB (from 0-11 to 17.71/g) did not appear to play a major role in the cholesterol-lowering properties. In addition, there was no correlation between the molecular weight of beta-glucan and the amount of propionic acid formed in caecum. Interestingly, however, there was a significant correlation between the ratio of (propionic acid + butyric acid)/acetic acid and the MWp of beta-glucans: the ratio increased with increasing molecular weight. The results of the present study suggest that the molecular weights and viscous properties of beta-glucan in oat products may not be crucial parameters for their cholesterol-lowering effects.",735,99,0,1,0,-1,1,1,2,1,188
"High pressure and rotor/stator homogenisation are widely used techniques in modifying rheologically interesting polysaccharides such as cereal beta-glucan for food purposes. However, the influence of the homogenisation-induced mechanical stress on beta-glucan has not been reported. The influence of three different homogenisers (two high-pressure homogenisers and a rotor/stator homogeniser) was examined in terms of the change in flow and molecular properties of oat beta-glucan in semi-dilute and concentrated solutions. A clear and irreversible decrease in viscosity and change in flow behaviour were observed after each homogenisation treatment of the semi-dilute solution. The viscosity had a linear relationship with molar mass in the high-pressure homogenised samples and they both decreased in parallel with the mechanical energy input. With the molar mass decrease, the shape of beta-glucan became more spherical and dense. In addition, the molecular weight distribution narrowed and storage-related viscosity stabilized. No considerable differences between the influences of the two high-pressure techniques were observed inconsistently with previous studies. Both molecular and technical characteristics were concluded to affect the fragmentation of beta-glucan in high-pressure homogenisation. Since homogenisation enhanced the structural stability of the solution and the fragmentation was dependent on the energy input, the techniques were concluded to be relevant methods for controlled fragmentation of beta-glucan.

"A method has been developed for the simultaneous analysis of 22 mycotoxins in wheat, barley, oats, rye and maize grain. Analysis is carried out with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. The compounds included in this analysis are aflatoxins, sterigmatocystin, cyclopiazonic acid, tricothecenes, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, zearalonone, and ergot alkaloids. Sample extraction (2 g) with acetonitrile:water (8 ml, 80:20) was carried out for 2 min using a commercial sample preparation apparatus (Stomacher (R)). The extract was then centrifuged, filtered and analysed. Extraction of fumonisins from maize (2 g) was optimised by first extracting the maize with acetonitrile: water (5 ml, 80:20) followed by the addition of water (3 ml), which permitted extraction of the 22 mycotoxins, including the fumonisins. Chromatography was carried out with a minicolumn (7.5x2.1 mm, 5 mu m) (5 mu l sample injection) and in 11 min, including column reconditioning. Analysis was carried out with 2 MRM transitions for the precursor ions. All method detection limits were below current maximum Canadian residue limits. Matrix effects for each compound in each of the 5 matrices were estimated and ranged from 70 to 149%, but most were 100 +/- 10%. Accuracy, repeatability and ruggedness were established. Proficiency samples from FERA (Food and Environment Research Agency, Sand Hutton, York, UK) were tested and are reported.

"The tendency of mixed linkage oat beta-glucan to form viscous solutions is generally assumed to be related to its ability to lower serum cholesterol levels in humans. However, the association has not been clearly demonstrated. To conduct a clinical trial showing the relationship between LDL-cholesterol levels and viscosity, a series of extruded oat bran cereals were prepared in which the beta-glucan had a range of molecular weights and modified solubility. An extraction protocol using physiological enzymes at 37 C was used to estimate the effect that the cereals would have on gut viscosity. By reducing the molecular weight from 1,930,000 to 251,000 g/mol, the apparent viscosity in the physiological extract dropped from 2900 to 131 mPa.s (at 30 s(-1)). Microscopic examination showed that as the extrusion conditions were made more severe, to cause depolymerization, the integrity of the cell walls was lost and beta-glucan dispersed throughout the cereal. Differences in the hardness and density of the extruded cereals were also evident as the molecular weight was reduced.",738,0,99,-1,0,1,1,1,2,1,167
"Three commercial wholegrain oat (WO) flours from Finland (WOF), Ireland (WOI) and Sweden (WOS) were evaluated for their bread making ability with the objective of finding predictive relationships between flour physicochemical properties and bread quality. Overall, significant differences were found in the bread making properties of the WO flours. Good bread quality was obtained when using WOS and W01 flour since breads showed high specific loaf volume and slice height as well as low density and hardness. Low quality breads were obtained when WOF flour was used. In addition, positive effects on oat bread quality were observed for low batter viscosity and high deformability, as obtained for WOS and W01. Based on the physicochemical analysis of the flours, water hydration capacity was found to be the main reason for increased elasticity of WOF batters. Small flour particle size, damaged starch granules and high protein content were identified as the key factors causing increased water hydration capacity. These findings suggest that WO flours with coarse particle size, limited starch damage and low protein content result in superior oat bread quality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Microsatellites are one of the most powerful marker systems for assesment of genetic diversity of plant species. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic relationships among Turkish hexaploid oat genotypes (Avenasativa L.) using microsatellite markers. Fifteen oat cultivars were analyzed as follows: nine cultivars of Turkish origins, one wild Turkish species, one Turkish breeding line, and four of USA origins. Among 17 locus specific microsatellite primers (AM), six (35%) generated polymorphic amplification products and were used for cultivar identification and determination of genetic relationships. Homozygous and heterozygous alleles were observed for AM1 and AM7 loci. Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) values were estimated within the range of 0 and 0.88, with an average of 0.66. One to 12 alleles were observed with the studied markers. Allele sizes were used to estimate simple matching (SM) similarities followed by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic Average (UPGMA). Based on these data, all genotypes were differentiated from each other, except Seydisehir and Yesilkoy 1779 cultivars.

"This study examined the effect of whole oat consumption in the oxidative stress induced by exercise in rats. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase [CAT] and glutathione peroxidase [GSH-Px]), lipid peroxidation by the measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in blood and plasma and also the total antioxidants (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) present in plasma were available. The animals submitted to a swimming exercise program for 15 days, which did not receive the oats, showed an increase in CAT level, while the animals that were fed the modified diet did not show the same increase. No differences were observed in GSH-Px and lipid peroxidation between groups. Antioxidant capacity was higher in the plasma of animals that were fed with the modified diet. This study indicates that whole oat supplementation may be beneficial against the oxidative stress induced by exercise. Pratical applications Currently, many people have been ingesting polyphenolic dietary supplements in an attempt to avoid free radical damage which has been linked to the aging process and some degenerative diseases. Among other factors, these free radicals are produced in the body during physical exercise.

"Probiotics must be consumed at a level of 10(7) CFU/mL for successful colonization of the gut. In yogurts containing beneficial cultures, the survival of probiotic strains can quickly decline below this critical concentration during cold storage. We hypothesized that beta-glucan would increase the viability of bifidobacteria strains in yogurt during cold storage. Yogurts were produced containing 0.44% beta-glucan (concentrated or freeze-dried) extracted from whole oat flour and/or 1.33% modified corn starch, and bifidobacteria (B. breve or B. longum) at a concentration of at least 10(9) CFU/mL. All yogurts were stored at 4 degrees C. Bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbureckii subsp. bulgaricus, were enumerated from undisturbed aliquots before fermentation, after fermentation, and once a week for 5 wk. S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus maintained a concentration of at least 10(8) CFU/mL in yogurts containing concentrated or freeze-dried beta-glucan regardless of starch addition, and in the control with no added beta-glucan or starch. Similarly, the probiotic, Bifidobacterium breve, survived above a therapeutic level in all treatments. The addition of beta-glucan prolonged the survival of Bifidobacterium longum at a concentration of at least 10(7) CFU/mL by up to 2 wk on average beyond the control. Further, the inclusion of concentrated beta-glucan in yogurt improved survival of B. longum above 10(7) CFU/mL by 1 wk longer than did freeze-dried beta-glucan.

"Low-fat sausages were prepared with various meats to investigate the effect of the addition of oatmeal at 10% as a fat substitute. The sausages were made with beef, pork and chicken after trimming the visible fat, and the physical and sensory properties of the sausages were evaluated. Beef sausage had the lowest cooking yield and the highest hardness, while chicken sausage showed the opposite properties. The addition of oatmeal resulted in sausage products with less cooking loss and softer texture for all types of meat sausages. Such changes were more pronounced for beef low-fat sausage than for the other types of sausages. The results of moisture absorption suggested that the difference in cooking yield and hardness among sausage products was due to the water-retention properties of different meats and the substitute in response to heat treatment. Sensory evaluation indicated that the greatest overall acceptability of the sausage products were obtained from 10% oatmeal-added pork sausage and that the addition of oatmeal led to better acceptability for all types meat sausages.",744,99,1,1,99,99,2,0,0,3,170

"This study aimed to quantify the changes caused by varying germination conditions on the contents of some bioactive compounds in barley and oats. Samples of the two grains were germinated at temperatures between 10 and 20 A degrees C for a period of 2-6 days, using a two-dimensional central composite design. The germination temperature had only minor effect in comparison with the germination time. Slight changes in the mineral content of the malts were observed, mainly caused by steeping. Phytate has been seen as an anti-nutritional compound, as it complexes minerals and lowers their bioavailability. The phytate content in barley malts was considerably lower than in the native kernels. Variations in the germination conditions did not have a significant effect on phytate content. In oats, degradation of phytate was significantly enhanced by prolonging the germination period. It was possible to retain the amounts of soluble dietary fibre, when short germination periods were applied. However, long germination periods caused an extensive breakdown of soluble dietary fibre, especially beta-glucan.

"Epidemiological evidence shows an inverse relationship between dietary fibre intake and body weight gain. Oat beta-glucan, a soluble fibre alters appetite hormones and subjective satiety in acute meal test studies, but its effects have not been demonstrated with chronic consumption. The present study aimed to test the effects in women of two different doses of oat beta-glucan on weight loss and hormones associated with appetite regulation. In a 3-month parallel trial, sixty-six overweight females were randomised into one of three 2 MJ energy-deficit diets: a control and two interventions including 5-6g or 8-9 g beta-glucan. Anthropometric and metabolic variables (blood glucose level, insulin, total cholesterol (TC), LDL, HDL, TAG and leptin), together with markers of appetite regulation (cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide-I (GLP-1), ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY) and PYY3.36) were measured at baseline and at 3 months. After 3 months, all groups lost weight (P<0.001) and showed a reduced waist circumference (P<0.001). The study sample also showed reductions in TC, LDL, HDL, leptin, PYY, GLP-1 values (all P<0.001) and an increase in CCK levels (P<0.001). No significant differences were noted between the groups for all outcome values except PYY levels (P=0.018).

"Commercial preparations of laccase (LAC) and glucose oxidase (GO) (0.01% and 0.1% addition levels), as well as of a protease (PR) (0.001% and 0.01% addition levels) were tested for their impact on the bread-making performance of gluten-free oat flour. LAC 0.1%, PR 0.001% and PR 0.01% additions significantly improved oat bread quality, as they increased specific volume and decreased crumb hardness and chewiness. In contrast, GO 0.1% addition revealed detrimental effects, as it resulted in the hardest bread crumb. The improved breadmaking performances of oat breads with LAC and PR addition was explained by the increase in batter softness, deformability and elasticity which were achieved upon addition of these enzyme preparations, both containing discernible levels of endo-beta-glucanase side activity. With LAC, the effect is due to prevalence of beta-glucan depolymerisation over protein polymerisation while, with PR, it is due to the combined effect of protein and beta-glucan degradation. Extensive protein hydrolysis during baking may have increased functionality of the soluble protein fraction. In contrast, extensive protein polymerisation was detrimental, as indicated by GO addition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",749,-1,99,0,1,1,2,1,1,1,181
"The effect of hydrostatic pressure (HP) has been investigated on cereal starches, proteins and flour systems, but its efficacy in cereal food processing has not been established. This study describes the use of HP as a tool to improve the bread-making performance of oat flour. For this purpose, oat batters were HP-treated at 200, 350 or 500 MPa, and the microstructure was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and bright field microscopy. Furthermore, HP-treated oat batters were added to an oat-bread recipe, replacing 10, 20 or 40% of untreated oat flour. Breads analysis revealed significantly improved bread volume upon addition of 10% oat batter treated at 200 MPa. The staling rate was reduced of all breads containing oat batter treated at 200 MPa. In contrast, bread quality deteriorated due to addition of oat batters treated at pressures a parts per thousand yen350 MPa, independent of the addition level. Overall, weakening of the protein structure, moisture redistribution and possibly changed interactions between proteins and starch were responsible for the positive effects of HP-treatment at 200 MPa on the bread-making performance of oat flour. Protein network formation and pre-gelatinisation of starch did not improve oat-bread quality.",750,99,99,0,-1,1,1,1,1,2,193
"The use of sourdough in wheat and rye breads has been extensively studied; however, little is known about its potential effect when baking oat bread. Consequently, the impact of sourdough on oat bread quality was investigated. Two different sourdoughs were prepared from wholegrain oat flour without the addition of starter cultures, by continuous propagation at 28 (SD 28) or 37 A degrees C (SD 37) until the composition of the lactic acid bacteria remained stable. The dominant LAB were identified by sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA isolated from pure cultures. LAB from SD 28 belonged to the species Leuconostoc argentinum, Pedicoccus pentosaceus and Weissella cibaria, while Lactobacillus coryniformis dominated SD 37. The isolated LAB were further used as starter cultures for the production of oat sourdoughs. Fundamental rheology revealed softening of the sourdoughs compared to non-acidified and chemically acidified controls, which could not be attributed to proteolytic activity. Incorporation of oat sourdough into an oat bread recipe resulted in significantly increased loaf-specific volume as well as improved texture, independent of addition level or sourdough type.

"The physicochemical properties of native and germinated oat seeds cultivated in China and their correlations were investigated. The growth curve during germination of oat seeds was described. The malt yield was 84% at the end of malting. The losses by removing of shoots and rootlets were the major cause of the total dry matter losses in the last 24 h of germination. With total starch enzymes activities increasing continuously, the starch content decreased considerably from 60% to 20%, and the reducing and soluble sugars contents increased. Oat seed kernel protein increased slightly, but the lysine content increased almost 30% at the end of germination. The phytic acid content declined from 0.35% to 0.11% during germination. There is a significant correlation among compositions including starch, protein, free and reducing sugars, free amino acid, and phytic acid. A close correlation also was found between the colour of malt flour dried at 50 degrees C and the length of shoots and rootlets. The results suggest that oats grown in China are a good food material and that germination can improve their nutritional properties. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"BACKGROUND: Normal pressure steaming (NPS), autoclaved steaming (AS), and hot-air roasting (HAR) are widely used to deactivate oat enzyme in the oat-processing industry. Infrared roasting (IR) is a new oat deactivation method, and is welcomed and employed by increasing numbers of oat-processing plants in China. It is widely known that oat starch plays an important role in the processing function of oat food, and that oat beta-glucan and lipid contribute greatly to the health benefits of oat food. However, the effects of steaming and roasting treatments on the starch, beta-glucan and lipid in oat kernels are poorly known. RESULTS: In this research, the level and distribution of beta-glucan and lipid in oat kernels with and without deactivation treatments were tested. We also measured the viscosity properties of oat flour from kernels after NIPS, AS, HAR and IR treatments, and examined the effects of these treatments on oat starch granularity using scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the deactivation treatments did not have significant effects on oat beta-glucan and lipid levels in oat kernels (P < 0.01). The distribution of beta-glucan and lipid in enzyme-deactivated kernels was very similar to that in normal kernels. NPS, AS, HAR and IR treatments changed the shape of starch granules, crumbled large starch granules, reduced the connection between the protein network and starch granules, and improved starch gelatinization properties. CONCLUSIONS: NPS, AS, HAIR and IR treatments can change the structure of oat starch granules and improve the viscosity property of oat starch without causing beta-glucan and lipid loss to oat food.

"Neogen Corp. developed the Veratox DON test kit for the detection of deoxynivalenol (DON). The purpose of this study was to validate the method under the requirements of the AOAC Research Institute Performance Tested Methods(SM) (PTM) program. There are two AOAC Official Methods(SM) for DON detection: 986.17 and 986.18, the first of which is a TLC method and the second a GC method. A rapid method (PTM 000701) has also been performance tested by the AOAC Research Institute. One of the most widely used reference methods; however, is a GC method with electron capture detection that is referred to as the reference method in this paper. Although considered the reference method, the GC procedure is complicated and requires the investment of both expensive equipment and a highly skilled technician. A rapid (e.g., ELISA) test kit needs to be validated by the AOAC Research Institute. The Veratox 2/3 method is highly reproducible with average CV values <10%, and is very accurate, showing >97% correlation to reference methods.",755,99,1,0,99,99,1,0,1,3,166
"Dietary fiber rich chicken meat patties were developed by incorporating wheat and oat bran to chicken meat at 5, 10 and 15% levels. Oat bran contained higher amount of soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) than wheat bran, whereas total dietary fiber (TDF), insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) and saturated fatty acids (SFA) were higher in wheat bran. Incorporation of bran significantly increased the water holding capacity (WHC) and emulsion stability (ES). Oat bran showed better effect on WHC and ES than wheat bran. Addition of bran resulted in significant increase in cooking yield, firmness, TDF, USFA and reduction in sensory attributes, moisture, protein, fat and cholesterol content. IDF was higher in wheat bran added patties and SDF and SFA/USFA ratio in oat bran added patties. It is concluded that oat and wheat bran can be incorporated up to 10 and 15% level, respectively for preparation of baked and steamed chicken patties.",756,1,1,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,154
"Cholesterol-lowering effects of oats have been demonstrated in both animals and human subjects. However, the crucial properties of oat-containing diets that determine their health effects need to be further investigated to optimise their use. A mouse model would be a valuable tool, but few such studies have been published to date. We investigated the effects of oat bran on plasma cholesterol and lipoproteins in two substrains of C57BL/6 mice. Western diet was made atherogenic by the addition of 0.8 % cholesterol and 0.1 % cholic acid. After 4 weeks on atherogenic diet, total plasma cholesterol had increased from 1.86-2-53 to 3.77-4-40 mmol/l. In C57BL/6NCrl mice, inclusion of 27 and 40% oat bran reduced total plasma cholesterol by 19 and 24 %, respectively, reduced the shift from HDL to LDL + VLDL and caused increased faecal cholesterol excretion. There was no effect of oat bran on plasma levels of the inflammatory markers fibrinogen, serum amyloid A or TNF-alpha. Contrary to findings in C57BL/6NCrl mice, there was no sustained effect of oat bran (27 or 40 %) on plasma cholesterol in C57BL/6JBomTac mice after 4 weeks of feeding. Thus, C57BL/6NCrl mice fed an atherogenic diet are a good model for Studies of physiological effects of oats, whereas a substrain derived from C57BL/6J, raised in a different breeding environment and likely possessing functional genetic differences from C57BL/6N, is considerably less responsive to oats. The present finding that two substrains of mice respond differently to oats is of practical value, but can also help to elucidate mechanisms of the cholesterol-lowering effect of oats.",757,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,259
"genotype of oats (CDC SO-I or SO-I) has been developed. The objectives of this study were to determine structural makeup (features) of oat grain in endosperm and pericarp regions and to reveal and identify differences in protein amide I and II and carbohydrate structural makeup (conformation) between SO-I and two conventional oats (CDC Dancer and Derby) grown in western Canada in 2006, using advanced synchrotron radiation based Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (SRFTIRM). The SRFTIRM experiments were conducted at National Synchrotron Light Sources, Brookhaven National Laboratory (NSLS, BNL, U.S. Department of Energy). From the results, it was observed that comparison between the new genotype oats and conventional oats showed (1) differences in basic chemical and protein subfraction profiles and energy values with the new SO-I oats containing lower lignin (21 g/kg of DM) and higher soluble crude protein (530 g/kg CP), crude fat (59 g/kg of DM), and energy values (TDN, 820 g/kg of DM; NEL3x, 7.8 MJ/kg of DM); (2) significant differences in rumen biodegradation kinetics of dry matter, starch, and protein with the new SO-I oats containing lower EDDM (638 g/kg of DM) and higher EDCP (103 g/kg of DM); (3) significant differences in nutrient supply with highest truly absorbed rumen undegraded protein (ARUP, 23 g/kg of DM) and total metabolizable protein supply (MP, 81 g/kg of DM) from the new SO-I oats; and (4) significant differences in structural makeup in terms of protein amide I in the endosperm region (with amide I peak height from 0.13 to 0.22 IR absorbance unit) and cellulosic compounds to carbohydrate ratio in the pericarp region (ratio from 0.02 to 0.06). The results suggest that with the SRFTIRM technique, the structural makeup differences between the new genotype oats (SO-I) and two conventional oats (Dancer and Derby) could be revealed.",758,0,1,0,99,0,1,0,3,1,296
"A method to obtain cis-9,trans-11-conjugated linoleic acid (c9,t11-CLA) into camelina meal and okara, the byproducts of plant oil processing, is described. The triacylglycerols in these materials were hydrolyzed with the aid of lipolytically active oat flour for 3 weeks at a water activity of 0.70. The resulting free linoleic acid was then isomerized predominantly to C9,t11-CLA by resting cells of Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii in 5% aqueous camelina meal and okara slurries. In camelina meal slurries, c9,t11-CLA content after 21 h of fermentation was 0.83 mg/mL and 96 mg/g of total lipids. In okara slurries, the content of c9,t11-CLA was 1.1 mg/mL and 78 mg/g of total lipids. Doubling the hydrolysis time in okara increased the subsequent content of C9,t11-CLA to 1.4 mg/mL, corresponding to 110 mg/g of total lipids. After isomerization, CLA was concentrated into a particulate material of the slurries by acidification. The results suggest that the method is applicable to a wide spectrum of lipid-containing plant materials to further increase their nutritional value.",759,1,99,1,1,99,3,0,0,2,166
"Objective Weight loss and consumption of viscous fibers both lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. We evaluated whether or not a whole-grain, ready-to-eat (RTE) oat cereal containing viscous fiber, as part of a dietary program for weight loss, lowers LDL cholesterol levels and improves other cardiovascular disease risk markers more than a dietary program alone. Design Randomized, parallel-arm, controlled trial. Subjects/setting Free-living, overweight and obese adults (N=204, body mass index 25 to 45) with baseline LDL cholesterol levels 130 to 200 mg/dL (3.4 to 5.2 mmol/L) were randomized; 144 were included in the main analysis of participants who completed the trial without significant protocol violations. Intervention Two portions per day of whole-grain RTE oat cereal (3 g/day oat b-glucan) or energy-matched low-fiber foods (control), as part of a reduced energy (similar to 500 kcal/day deficit) dietary program that encouraged limiting consumption of foods high in energy and fat, portion control, and regular physical activity. Main outcome measures Fasting lipoprotein levels, waist circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, and body weight were measured at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 10, and 12. Results LDL cholesterol level was reduced significantly more with whole-grain RTE oat cereal vs control (-8.7 +/- 1.0 vs 4.3 +/- 1.1%, P=0.005). Total cholesterol (-5.4 +/- 0.8 vs 2.9 +/- 0.9%, P=0.038) and non high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-6.3 +/- 1.0 vs 3.3 +/- 1.1%, P=0.046) were also lowered significantly more with whole-grain RTE oat cereal, whereas high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride responses did not differ between groups. Weight loss was not different between groups (-2.2 +/- 0.3 vs 1.7 +/- 0.3 kg, P=0.325), but waist circumference decreased more (-3.3 +/- 0.4 vs 1.9 +/- 0.4 cm, P=0.012) with whole-grain RTE oat cereal.

"Contamination of Fusarium moulds and subsequent production of mycotoxins is a common problem in cereals grown in Northern Europe. Oats is the third most important cereal crop in Sweden and is commonly contaminated by Fusarium. To date there are no published reports on the distribution of trichothecene-producing Fusaria in Swedish oats and correlation to T-2 and HT-2, the two most dominant toxins. Identification of Fusarium species by traditional methods requires specific skill and experience and quantification of specific species is not possible. Using modern molecular methods such as real-time PCR both identification and quantification of specific Fusarium species are possible directly from the food or feed samples. In this study, specific methods for Fusarium langsethiae, Fusarium sporotrichioides, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium culmorum and Fusarium poae as well as for the total amount of DNA from trichothecene-producing species were evaluated with respect to precision, robustness and efficiency and then used in the analysis of oat samples. Sixty-two oat samples were taken from field trial harvests from 2006-2008 in the central and southern parts of Sweden and analysed for the presence of Fusarium species by using species-specific real-time PCR-based methods with TaqMan or SYBR Green biochemistry. The T-2 and HT-2 toxin content was analysed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection of the toxins' pentafluoropropyl derivatives. The results showed that E langsethiae and E poae were the most dominant Fusarium species among those tested in Swedish oats during this period. The DNA level of F langsethiae correlated well with the level of T-2 and HT-2 toxin (r=0.7), indicating that this species was the most important producer of T-2 and HT-2 toxins in Swedish oats during the sampling period (2006 to 2008). It can also be concluded that real-time PCR is a powerful tool when studying Fusarium species distribution in oats.",761,1,99,99,1,99,2,0,0,3,297
"The evidence of the effect of the age at introduction of new foods during infancy on the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis is inconsistent and scarce. We set out to study these associations. A prospective birth cohort of infants with increased HLA-DQB1-conferred risk for type 1 diabetes was recruited in 1996-2000. The families completed at home a record on the age at introduction of new foods. Persistent asthma and allergic rhinitis were assessed at the age of 5 years with an International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood-type questionnaire. The Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were adjusted for parental asthma and allergic diseases, and several perinatal and sociodemographical factors. Out of the 1293 children. 77 (6.0 %) developed persistent asthma: and out of the 1288 children. 185 (14.4 %) developed allergic rhinitis by the age of 5 years. Early age at introduction of oats was associated with a reduced risk of persistent asthma (hazard ratio (HR: 95 % Cl) for the first and mid-tertiles compared with the latest tertile was 0.36 (0.15, 0.85) and 0.37 (0.22, 0.62), respectively, P<0.001).

"Oats are a versatile grain for food, animal feed, and non-food products due to its unique grain qualities compared to other cereal grains. Known as nature's functional food, oats for human consumption are responsible for a number of health benefits beyond basic nutrition. Although the consumption of oat food products has increased dramatically over the last 25 years due to these health benefits, the highest proportion of the oat crop is utilised as animal feed. Recent research has identified grain quality traits that improve the nutritive value of oats as an animal feed compared to many other cereals. Historically oats have been used for non-food products, but expansion in the food use of oats will increase the value of the crop. Improvement of oat varieties for food, animal feed, and non-food grain quality traits by plant breeding will create new opportunities for the future of this crop.",765,1,99,1,1,99,3,0,0,2,147
"Background/Objectives: We have shown earlier that consumption of moderate amount of oats improve intakes of vitamin B(1), fiber, magnesium and iron in celiac patients using gluten-free diet (GFD). The objective of this study was to clarify the effect of high amount of both kilned and unkilned oats on food and nutrient intakes in celiac patients in remission. Kilning as an industrial heating process is performed to preserve the main properties of oats and to lengthen its useableness. Kilning may, however, change the protein structure of oats and therefore influence on the intake of nutrients. Subjects/Methods: The study group consisted of 13 men and 18 women with celiac disease in remission. The patients who were earlier using moderate amount of oats as part of their GFD were randomized to consume kilned or unkilned oats. After 6 months, the patients changed the treatment groups. The goal of daily intake of oats was 100 g. Food records and frequency questionnaire were used to follow nutrient intakes. Results: Type of oats did not affect the amount of oats used. In the group using kilned oats, the intake of vitamin B1 and magnesium and in the group of unkilned oats that of magnesium and zinc increased significantly during the first 6 months (P <= 0.05). Conclusions: Large amounts of oats, both kilned and unkilned in GFD, can increase intakes of nutrients in celiac patients in remission. Oats improve the nutritional value of GFD.

"For the Fusarium trichothecene mycotoxins T-2 and HT-2, a combined (T-2 + HT-2) temporary tolerable daily intake (tTDI) of 0.06 mu g kg-1 body weight day-1 was proposed at the European level in 2001 (Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food). In the near future, maximum levels for these trichothecenes will be regulated by the European Commission as announced in EU (VO) 1881/2006. For the implementation of these maximum levels, more data on occurrence and behaviour of T-2 and HT-2 toxins in primary agricultural products as well as during cleaning treatment and food processing are needed. In the current work, we determined the T-2/HT-2 concentrations in four oat cultivars (Aragon, Dominik, Ivory, Pergamon) from ten different agricultural sites in Germany, grown in cultivar studies in 2007. The grains were de-hulled, oat meal was prepared, and bread with 20% oat meal and 80% wheat flour was baked. In the cereal-processing chain, samples were taken at various steps and subsequently analysed for their T-2/HT-2 content. We employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and an immunological screening method (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA)) for T-2/HT-2 determination. Detection limits were between 1 and 10 mu g kg-1 in different matrices. T-2/HT-2 concentrations determined by ELISA in oat samples from ten different agricultural sites in Germany were between 9 and 623 mu g kg-1. The median and 90th percentile were 48 and 191 mu g kg-1 T-2/HT-2, respectively. One site showed six times higher T-2/HT-2 levels than the other sites, where concentrations ranged from 322 to 623 mu g kg-1. In 80% of the samples the cultivars Pergamon and Ivory had the lowest concentration of T-2 and HT-2 toxins. Using LC-MS for T-2/HT-2 determination, cleaning of the raw material did not lead to significant reductions of T-2 and HT-2 levels, whereas de-hulling led to a reduction of over 90%. Boiling of oat meal produced from cleaned raw material to yield 'porridge' resulted in varying T-2/HT-2 levels in experimental r",767,1,99,99,1,99,2,0,0,3,322
"Background: Soluble fibre has been proposed to suppress appetite-related perceptions and it could thus contribute favourably to the regulation of energy intake and the increasing obesity problem. Objective: To investigate the effect of an oat ingredient rich in beta-glucan on perceived satiety at different dietary fibre (DF) concentrations, energy levels and viscosity levels. Design: A total of 29 healthy volunteers, age 19-39, mean BMI 23.2 kg/m(2) participated in this study. Measurement of subjective perceptions (satiety, fullness, hunger, desire to eat something/the sample food and thirst) was performed during a 180-min period after ingestion of the sample. There were altogether six samples: two beverages without fibre at energy levels 700 and 1,400 kJ; two beverages containing 5 or 10 g oat DF (2.5 and 5 g oat beta-glucan, respectively) at energy level 700 kJ, one beverage containing 10 g oat DF/1,400 kJ and one beverage containing 10 g enzymatically treated oat DF with low viscosity at energy level 700 kJ. Each beverage portion weighted 300 g. The order of the samples was randomised for each subject and evaluated during six separate days. The results are reported in three sets of samples: 'fibre', 'energy' and 'viscosity'. Results: In the fibre set, the beverages containing 5 or 10 g of fibre had a larger area under curve (AUC) for perceived satiety and smaller AUC for hunger compared to the beverage without fibre, but no significant dose-response relationship was detected. Increasing the energy content from 700 to 1,400 kJ in the energy set did not affect the satiety-related perceptions. In the viscosity set, the beverage with low-viscosity beta-glucan increased satiety-related perceptions from no fibre containing beverage, but less compared to the beverage with the same amount of fibre and higher viscosity. Conclusions: Addition of an oat ingredient rich in beta-glucan and high viscosity of beverages enhance post-meal satiety induced by beverages.

"Oats are of special interest due to their physiological properties and the fact that they can be consumed by most celiac patients. Oat beer could be a gluten-free alternative to traditional barley malt beer. Knowledge of protein changes during brewing is technologically relevant because they influence foam and haze formation. The aim of this study was to follow protein changes during brewing of common barley malt beer compared with an alternative made from oat malt. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and lab-on-a-chip analysis were used to obtain protein profiles of malts, worts, hot trubs, and beers. In barley beer, the most abundant proteins were detected, including protein Z. lipid transfer protein I, and other low molecular weight proteins.

"The influence of germination time and germination temperature on protein breakdown in buckwheat and oats was investigated using, RSM as a statistical tool. Variations in germination temperature between 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C and germination times between 48 h and 144 h had no statistically significant (p < 0.05) impact on Total Nitrogen (TN) and Soluble Nitrogen (SN) in buckwheat malts; only Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN) increased as a consequence of prolonged germination time. Protease activity was low and was not influenced by the germination parameters. In oat malts. TN was not affected, however the SN increased with prolonged germination times and FAN was also affected by germination time and temperature. Protease activity in oat malts could be strongly increased by choosing appropriate germination conditions. The molecular weight of the malt proteins was investigated using. a Lab-on-a-chip system based on capillary electrophoresis. Protein breakdown was more pronounced in samples germinated for longer times in both grains; however, not all proteins were affected.

"Dietary components, like beta-glucans, can modulate the intestinal immune response. We previously showed that fecal water enriched with oat beta-glucan stimulated the cytokine-induced immune response of enterocytes. It is, however, unclear whether beta-glucans activate nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathways in the intestine in vivo and if so, whether enterocytes, intestinal leukocytes, or both respond to beta-glucans. We evaluated the effects of an oral gavage of 3 mg dietary oat (1 -> 3), (1 -> 4)-beta-D-glucans that was administered twice daily during 3.5 days on intestinal NF-kappa B transactivation and subsequent cytokine production of intestinal leukocytes and enterocytes in 16 NF-kappa B reporter mice. We hypothesized that oat beta-glucan activates the central immune transcription factor NF-kappa B and increased cytokine secretion, as we previously reported immune stimulating effects by oat beta-glucan. We found that mice that were administered oat beta-glucans (n = 8) showed an increased intestinal NF-kappa B transactivation in leukocytes (P = .021) and enterocytes (P = .012), particularly in the proximal part of the small intestine (ileum), as compared to placebo mice (n = 8). Surprisingly, NF-kappa B was not activated in the colon. Furthermore, the level of interleukin 12 was increased in intestinal lysates from all compartments, whereas the concentration of interferon gamma was decreased in the proximal small intestine (P = .046). Finally, tumor necrosis factor alpha showed a trend toward a reduced production in the colon (P = .057). Because we have earlier shown that human enterocyte cell lines do not express the beta-glucan receptor dectin-1 in vitro, we now conclude that after consumption, dietary oat beta-glucans most likely firstly activate the intestinal leukocytes, which in turn increases cellular activation of enterocytes.

"Low-fat high-fiber mutton kofta containing minced meat and optimized quantities of refined wheat flour (8.5%), oat flour (8.0%) and carrageenan (0.5%) was prepared. The product with wheat flour (9.0%) and fat (8.0%) and without oat flour and carrageenan was treated as control. The product was deep fat fried, packed under air or nitrogen and stored at 4 +/- 2C. Inclusion of oat flour and carrageenan resulted in substantially lower contents of fat and higher moisture content compared with control. The carrageenan-containing product was softer in texture and juicier than control. Color traits b and L values of the product were affected by addition of carrageenan and oat flour in the formulation, whereas the value of a was unaffected. Decrease in pH, chewiness and other sensory attributes were noticed in kofta stored for 6 weeks. Products stored in nitrogen had better keeping quality and were sensorily acceptable up to 6 weeks. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Growing awareness of the risk between diet and health is changing consumer habits fast, so that there has been an increasing demand for foods with health-enhancing properties such as high-fiber and low-fat meat products. The apparent relationship between dietary fat and development of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and obesity has prompted consumers to be aware of and concerned about the amount of fat in their diet. A major problem in the acceptability of low-fat processed meat products is the decline in palatability with fat reduction.

"Samples from naked oat were steeped and germinated under controlled conditions in an incubator. Changes of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were investigated in oats during steeping and germination. Results revealed that phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of oats varied with the difference in steeping and germination stages. Compared with raw grains, short-term steeping treatment did not show significant effects (p > 0.05) on phenolic content. Germination can significantly result in the decrease in bound phenolic and the increase in free and total phenolics. Main phenolic acids and avenanthramides were isolated and quantified by HPLC analysis. During steeping, phenolic acids decreased (p < 0.05); avenanthramide N-(3',4'-dihydroxy)-(E)-cinnamoyl-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid first decreased and then increased (p < 0.05), while avenanthramides N-(4'-hydroxy)-(E)-cinnamoyl-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid and N-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy)-(E)-cinnamoyl-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid did not change significantly (p > 0.05). During germination, gallic and caffeic acids first increased (p < 0.05) and then decreased, whereas p-coumaric and ferulic acids and avenanthramides increased (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, avenanthramides did not change significantly (p > 0.05) during the last stage of germination. Oat extracts exhibited increasing high antioxidant activity with the steeping and germination going on, which may explain that antioxidant activity correlated (p < 0.01) significantly with the content of phenolic compounds.",776,1,99,0,99,1,2,0,1,2,200
"Effects of various enzymes and extraction conditions on yield and molecular weight of beta-glucans extracted from two batches of commercial oat bran produced in Sweden are reported. Hot-water extraction with a thermostable alpha-amylase resulted in an extraction yield of approximate to 76% of the beta-glucans, while the high peak molecular weight was maintained (1.6 x 10(6)). A subsequent protein hydrolysis significantly reduced the peak molecular weight of beta-glucans (by pancreatin to 908 x 10(3) and by papain to 56 x 10(3)). These results suggest that the protein hydrolyzing enzymes may not be pure enough for purifying beta-glucans. The isolation scheme consisted of removal of lipids with ethanol extraction, enzymatic digestion of starch with alpha-amylase, enzymatic digestion of protein using protease, centrifugation to remove insoluble material, removal of low molecular weight components using dialysis, precipitation of beta-glucans with ethanol, and air-drying.",777,99,99,99,1,-1,1,1,0,3,140
"Commercial processing of oats for human consumption generally requires impact dehulling to isolate groats from the hull. Impact dehulling involves feeding oat grain into the center of a spinning rotor that expels the grain against the walls of the dehuller. The force of the impact breaks the hull from the groat. We have tested the effect of rotor speed oil dehulling efficiency, groat breakage, and unbroken groat yield on 18 oat genotypes from replicated plots in six different environments. Dehulling efficiency and groat breakage increased with rotor speed with all genotypes and environments, but there were significant genotypic and environmental effects as well. In general, genotypes with higher test weight and kernel density dehulled more efficiently at slower rotor speeds. Oat genotypes with higher oil and protein concentrations in their groats tended to break less during dehulling. Oats from hotter, drier environments suffered greater groat breakage. Maximal unbroken groat yield represented a balance between dehulling efficiency and groat breakage, but groat proportion and dehulling efficiency appeared to be the most important factors contributing to groat yield.",778,99,1,1,99,1,3,0,0,2,176
"Starch and protein separated from oat were chemically modified using cross-linking and acetylation protocols for starch, and deamidation and succinylation for protein isolate. Cross-linking decreased swelling power of starch, whereas syneresis increased, but cross-linking does not have a significant effect on gelatinization temperature. Acetylation increased swelling power, but gelatinization temperature and syneresis diminished. Deamidation and succinylation increased nitrogen solubility index, emulsion activity, foaming capacity, and water and oil binding capacity. Emulsion stability did not change with deamidation and it diminished with succinylation, while foaming stability decreased with both treatments. Acetylated starch and two types of modified proteins were Substituted for 5, 10, 15, and 20% of oat flour to bake cake samples and then physical properties of the cakes were measured. Acetylated starch increased batter viscosity, cake volume, and whiteness of cake crust. Increased level of deamidated protein produced cakes with lower batter viscosity, higher volume, and darker color (increase in redness). Application of higher levels of succinylated protein led to higher batter viscosity and lightness, and lower cake volume. Therefore, substitution of deamidated protein and acetylated starch can improve cake properties.",779,1,99,1,99,0,2,0,1,2,182
"Total (non-fractionated) kernel proteins and the prolamin fraction (soluble in 75% ethanol) were extracted from oat (Avena sativa) var. Flamingstern kernel and from buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) var. Kora kernel. As for buckwheat, extraction was effective only after kernel dehulling which allowed the removal of tannins and phenolic compounds that form complexes with proteins during extraction. The extracted proteins were analyzed using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Gels of the prolamin fractions of oat and buckwheat were used as reference gels in order to detect prolamins on gels of total kernel proteins. The occurrence of 26 and 29 spots corresponding to prolamins was found on gels of total oat proteins and on gels of total buckwheat proteins, respectively. The electrophoretic images of oat and buckwheat prolamins revealed organized subregions containing spots with similar isoelectric points (pI) and various molecular weights (MW), mostly on oat prolamin gels and spots of similar molecular weights with various isoelectric points, mostly on buckwheat prolamin gels. Such organized subregions can be used as identifiers for the occurrence of prolamin fractions in total proteins (particularly as regards buckwheat proteins).",780,0,0,0,99,0,0,0,4,1,182
"To investigate the primary factors affecting the efficiency of microwave heating pretreatments in inactivating lipase in naked oat kernels, the effects of temperature, duration of heating, moisture content of oat kernels, tempering time and packaging conditions on the inactivation of lipase activities were examined. Microwave heat treatment for 45 s was found to inactivate 98-99% lipase in oat kernels (20 g in polyethylene package) with 11.1% moisture content, thereby stabilizing oat kernels against triglyceride lipolysis. The steam quantity played a crucial role in lipase inactivation. A trend was found: the higher the quantity of steam evaporated, the lower the residual lipase activities remained in whole kernels. Pretreatments, such as vacuum packaging, increasing the moisture content of oat kernels to a range of 17.0-25.0% from 11.1%, and conducting heat treatments as soon as the kernel moisture contents were adjusted, were found to be beneficial in accelerating steam evaporation; the efficiency of microwave heating on lipase inactivation was thereby increased.

"A clear understanding of how diet alters gastrointestinal communities is important given the suggested link between gut community composition and a wide variety of disease pathologies. To characterize this link for commonly consumed dietary fiber sources, we investigated the change in the fecal community of rats fed diets containing 5% nonnutritive fiber (control), 3% (wt:wt) oat bran plus 2% nonnutritive fiber (OB), or 5% (w/w) wheat bran (WB) over a 28-d feeding trial using both molecular- and cultivation-based methodologies. Pooled fecal samples from 8 rats fed the same diet were analyzed at 4 time points. On d 28, bran-fed rats had approximately twice the total cultivable bacteria than rats fed the control diet. Over the course of feeding, the cultivable community was initially dominated by bacteroides, then by bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, enterococci, and various enterics. In contrast, molecular analysis revealed the appearance of new operational taxonomic units (phylotypes) that were both temporally and inequitably distributed throughout the fecal community. The majority of change occurred in 2 major lineages within the Firmicutes: the Clostridium coccoides group and the Clostridium leptum subgroup. The time course of change depended on the source of bran, with the majority of new phylotypes appearing by d 14 (OB) or d 28 (WB), although adaptation of the fecal community was slow and continued over the entire feeding trial. Bacterial community richness was higher in bran-fed rats than in those fed the control diet. Change within the C. coccoides and C. leptum lineages likely reflect their high abundance within the gut bacterial community and the role of clostridia in fiber digestion. The results illustrate the limitations of relying solely on cultivation to assess bacterial changes and illustrate that community changes are complex in an ecosystem containing high numbers of interdependent and competing species of bacteria.

"To assess the effect of food processing on the capacity of oat beta-glucan to attenuate postprandial glycemia, isocaloric crisp bread, granola, porridge, and pasta containing 4 g of beta-glucan as well as control products with low beta-glucan content were prepared. The physicochemical properties (viscosity,peak molecular weight (M-p), and concentration (C)) of beta-glucan in in-vitro-digestion extracts were evaluated, and fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations were measured in human subjects. Porridge and granola had the highest efficacy in attenuating the peak blood glucose response (PBGR) because of their high M-p and viscosity. beta-Glucan depolymerization in bread and pasta reduced beta-glucan bioactivity. Pastas, known to have low glycemic responses, showed the lowest PBGR. The analyses of these products with previously reported data indicated that 73% of the bioactivity in reducing PBGR can be explained by M-p x C.

"The potential for producing anti hypertensive peptides from oat proteins through enzymatic hydrolysis was assessed in silico and confirmed in vitro. Thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27) was predicted using BIOPEP database as the enzyme that would theoretically produce the most angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from oat. Experimental evidence confirmed that strong ACE-inhibitory activity was produced under various hydrolysis conditions. Hydrolysates produced under high enzyme-to-substrate ratio (3%) short time (20 min) (HEST) and low enzyme-to-substrate ratio (0.1%) long time (120 min) (LELT). conditions had IC50 values of 30 and 50 mu g/mL, respectively. After simulated gastrointestinal digestion, the IC50 of the HEST hydrolysate was 35 mu g/mL whereas the IC50 of the LELT hydrolysate was higher at 85 mu g/mL. Ultrafiltration revealed that potent ACE-inhibitory peptides had molecular weights below 3 kDa.

"Starch samples separated from oat were modified with two different levels of POCl3 (0.5 and 1.0 g kg(-1)) as a cross-linking agent and two different levels of acetic anhydride (6% and 8% (w/w)) for acetylation. Swelling factor, thermal properties and retrogradation measurements were evaluated to characterise the influence of phosphorylation and acetylation on oat starch. Cross-linking decreased the swelling factor and did not improve gelatinization temperature while it increased synaeresis in comparison with native starch. Acetylation increased swelling factor but reduced gelatinization temperature and synaeresis of oat starch. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",785,0,99,99,99,99,0,0,1,4,95
"Oat beta-glucan hydrolysates with different molecular weights were prepared and their physicochemical, hypocholesterolemic, and weight-reducing characteristics were evaluated. The enzymatic hydrolysis by cellulase caused a decrease in the molecular weight of oat beta-glucan (1450-370 x 10(3) g/mol), which also affected swelling power and bile acid/fat binding capacities. In addition, mice were fed high-fat diet supplemented with beta-glucans with three different molecular weights (1450, 730, 370 x 10(3) g/mol). The diets treated with beta-glucans significantly reduced the body weight of the mice. However, the molecular weight of beta-glucans did not appear to significantly affect the serum lipid profile.

"To evaluate the effects of processes on physicochemical properties of oat bran soluble dietary fiber (OSDF), the oat bran was processed by steam heating, superfine grinding, and extrusion, and extracted to obtain OSDF. The molecular weight distribution, monosaccharide composition, transparency, solubility, structure, and thermal and morphological properties of OSDF were investigated. The yield of OSDF increased after the processing compared to the untreated. The proportion of high molecular weight granules was higher in OSDF from extruded oat bran. The backbone of the OSDF was not changed, but the proportion of the residue linkages in OSDF was varied after the processing. Solubility and swelling power showed significant positive correlation with molecular weight distribution while transparency showed significant negative correlation with molecular weight distribution. Three processes had great impact on the physicochemical properties of OSDF. The OSDF from superfine ground oat bran showed some physical-chemical properties that might be of potential use in the food industry.",787,99,99,1,99,0,1,0,1,3,154
"BACKGROUND: Oats are not widely utilised in poultry rations. The principal reason for this is their high fibre content. Fibre is not very digestible by poultry and its presence impairs the digestibility of energy and other nutrients. A new low-lignin hull/high-oil groat (LLH/HOG) oat was developed recently and the present study was conducted to determine its nutritional value for poultry. RESULTS: In experiment 1, gain of broiler chicks fed the control was higher (P < 0.01) than that of birds fed normal oat. Gain and intake of birds fed LLH/HOG oat were superior (P < 0.01) to those of birds fed normal oat. Feed conversion (FC) was higher for birds fed the control than for birds fed normal oat (P < 0.01), while FC for birds fed the control and LLH/HOG oat did not differ (P > 0.05). FC was better for birds fed LLH/HOG than for birds fed normal oat (P < 0.01). In experiment 2, weight gain (P < 0.01), feed intake (P < 0.01) and FC (P = 0.07) declined as the level of LLH/HOG oat in the diet increased. CONCLUSION: Feeding LLH/HOG oat to broilers improved weight gain and FC compared with feeding normal oat. These results give a strong indication that LLH/HOG oat is superior to normal oat as an energy source for poultry. However, despite improvements in chemical composition, LLH/HOG oat is still inferior to wheat for use in broiler rations. (C) 2009 Society of Chemical Industry",788,1,-1,99,-1,1,2,2,0,1,243
"This study recorded acute biochemical and subjective measures of satiety, followed by energy intake from a subsequent meal, after varying doses of beta-glucan in extruded breakfast cereals. Molecular weight, solubility and viscosity of beta-glucan products were determined. Seven male and seven female subjects (BMI 25-36 kg/m) consumed five breakfasts (different doses of beta-glucan sourced from two different technological processes) and dietary intake was measured after four hours. Blood was collected to measure glucose, insulin, ghrelin and cholecystokinin, and visual analogue scales measured subjective satiety. Molecular weight, solubility and viscosity indicated products were likely to increase luminal viscosity. beta-Glucan was found to decrease insulin secretion over 2 h (RMANOVA, p = 0.011) in a dose responsive manner from 2.16 to 5.68 g per serving (p = 0.007). Cholecystokinin levels increased linearly over the same range of beta-glucan concentrations (p = 0.002) in women. Subjective satiety was increased at a beta-glucan dose of 2.2 g (p = 0.039). Subsequent meal intake decreased by greater than 400 with higher beta-glucan dose (>5 g). beta-Glucan improves satiety and release of cholecystokinin is likely to be part of the mechanism.

"Peptide Y-Y (PYY) is an anorexigenic hormone implicated in appetite control, and beta-glucan is a fiber known to affect appetite. We hypothesized that plasma PYY levels would increase in overweight human adults consuming increasing doses of beta-glucan. The objective was to test whether the effect could be seen with beta-glucan delivered through extruded cereals containing a high beta-glucan oat bran with demonstrated high molecular weight and solubility. Fourteen subjects consumed a control meal and 3 cereals of varying beta-glucan concentration (between 2.2 and 5.5 g), and blood samples were collected over 4 hours. Analysis of raw PYY data showed a trend toward significant increases over 4 hours. Ail increasing dose of beta-glucan resulted in higher levels of plasma PYY, with significant differences between groups from 2 to 4 hours post test-meal. Data for the area under the curve analysis also approached significance, with post hoc analysis showing a difference (P = .039) between the control and the highest dose of beta-glucan (5.5 g). The PYY levels at 4 hours were significantly different between the control and high-dose meal test (P = .036). There was a significant dose response, with a positive correlation between the grains of beta-glucan and PYY area under the curve (r(2) = 0.994, P = .003). The optimal dose of beta-glucan appears to lie between 4 and 6 g, with the effects on PYY mediated by viscosity and concentration.

It was found that the experimental data in the water activity range considered were better represented by the four-parameter Peleg equation. The monolayer water contents for both materials were determined by the BET and GAB models. The net isosteric heats of sorption were estimated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

"The kinetics of phase separation and microstructure of oat beta-glucan/whey protein binary mixtures varying in concentration (4-16% w/v protein, 0.3-1.2% w/v beta-glucan) and beta-glucan molecular weight (1.3 x 10(6), 640 x 10(3), 180 x 10(3), and 120 x 10(3) g/mol) was investigated by turbidimetry and fluorescent microscopy. The phase separation of the mixed systems was followed at pH 7.0 and at room temperature under quiescent conditions. Application of first principles revealed that phase separation of the systems follows first-order kinetics. Acceleration of the phase-separation process was observed with increase of beta-glucan concentration for the three lowest-MW samples but the highest molecular weight (1.3 x 10(6) g/mol) exhibited the opposite trend. Changes in the polysaccharide molecular weight resulted in considerable differences in beta-glucan aggregate morphology in the mixed systems.

"A Monte Carlo simulation technique was employed to simulate the factors influencing the level of beta-glucan content in both hulled (HO) and naked (NO) oat cultivars during cultivation of the crop. Probability density functions were used to model the uncertainty and variability in the input factors.

The simulated mean beta-glucan level in harvested oats grain was 3.50 and 4.25 g/100 g for hulled (HO) and naked (NO), respectively. A sensitivity analysis highlighted that cultivar selection was the most important input parameter compared to other inputs in determining the final beta-glucan level (correlation coefficients of 0.64 and 0.79 for HO and NO, respectively). The analysis also indicated the positive effect of delayed sowing on beta-glucan content (correlation coefficients of 0.32 and 0.25 for HO and NO, respectively). Germination and storage factors showed a negative impact on the final beta-glucan levels. The scenario analysis shows the applicability of the proposed model for various agronomic practices.

"The effects of organic acids (ascorbic, citric and malic acids) associated with beverages were studied in an unpurified oat beta-glucan extract with the purpose of examining the stability of cereal beta-glucan in beverage conditions. Addition of ascorbic acid caused an immediate decrease in viscosity of the extract and the MW of beta-glucan. Citric and malic acid affected moderately and only after a heat treatement. This indicated a dominating role of ascorbic acid induced oxidative cleavage compared to the generally proposed acid hydrolysis of beta-glucan. The nature of ascorbic acid induced cleavage was studied with inhibitors (glucose, mannitol, catalase and phytic acid) and catalysts (Cu- and Fe-ions) of hydroxyl radical attacks. Glucose, mannitol and catalase inhibited and the metals effectively catalysed the viscosity decrease. These indicated that the degradation of beta-glucan in the ascorbic acid treated extract was induced by metal-catalysed hydroxyl radicals. Also, the beta-glucan extract used as a matrix lost its viscosity during storage (+6 degrees C) concurrently with MW decrease of beta-glucan. When added to the extract, mannitol, glucose and catalase each showed a slight stabilising trend and Fe(2+) -ions caused an immediate decrease in viscosity. The oxidative cleavage appeared to be an important factor to consider in developing novel aqueous beta-glucan enriched products. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"BACKGROUND: Avenanthramides, health-beneficial phenols in oats, are produced in response to incompatible races of the crown rust fungus, Puccinia coronata, in seedlings of greenhouse-grown oats. This study aimed to elucidate whether avenanthramides and/or other phenolic compounds, together with the activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), phenoloxidase (PO) and the avenanthramide biosynthetic enzyme hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: hydroxyanthranilate-N-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HHT), are associated with crown rust infection in mature field-grown oats. Nine oat (Avena sativa L.) genotypes with wide variation in crown rust resistance were exposed to naturally occurring fungal spores during the growth period. RESULTS: In the spikelets avenanthramides as well as HHT activities were more abundant in the crown rust resistant genotypes, whereas p-coumaric and caffeic acids were more abundant in the susceptible ones. In the leaves avenanthramides were not associated with resistance. Instead two unknown compounds correlated negatively with the rust score. Phenols released by alkaline hydrolysis and PAL and PO activities were not related to rust infection, either in spikelets or in the leaves. CONCLUSION: Because grains of crown rust-resistant oat genotypes seemed to have higher endogenous levels of health-promoting avenanthramides, use of resistant oats may contribute to a food raw material with health-beneficial effects.

"(7.70% P-glucan), were used to study the effect of beta-glucan levels in oat flours during simulated in vitro digestion and fermentation with human fecal flora obtained from different individuals. The oat flours were digested by using human digestion enzymes and fermented by batch fermentation under anaerobic conditions for 24 h. The fermentation progress was monitored by measuring pH, total gas, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Significant effects of beta-glucan on the formation of gas and total SCFA were observed compared to the blank without substrate (P < 0.05); however, there were no differences in pH changes, total gas, and total SCFA production among oat lines (P > 0.05). Acetate, propionate, and butyrate were the main SCFA produced from digested oat flours during fermentation. More propionate and less acetate were produced from digested oat flours compared to lactulose. Different human fecal floras obtained from three healthy individuals had similar patterns in the change of pH and the production of gas during fermentation, Total SCFA after 24 h of fermentation were not different, but the formation rates of total SCFA differed between individuals.

"Consumers occasionally report greenish colors generated in their oat products when cooking in tap water. Here we have investigated pH and ferrous (Fe(2+)) ion as possible mechanisms for this color change. Steel-cut oat groats can turn brown-green color when cooked in alkaline conditions (pHs 9 to 12). Extraction of this color with methanol, and high-pressure liquid chromatography indicated a direct association of this color with the phenolic acid or avenanthramide content of the oat. The presence of 50 mM NaHCO(3) in water will cause oat/water mixtures to turn alkaline when cooked as CO(2) is driven off, generating OH-ion. Although tap water rarely, if ever, contains so much bicarbonate, bicarbonate is used as a leavening agent in baking applications. Industrial interests using baking soda or alkaline conditions during oat processing should be aware of possible off color generation. We have also found that as little as 10 ppm Fe(2+) will turn oat products gray-green when cooked. The aleurone stained darker than the starchy endosperm. Other divalent cations, such as Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) had no effect on cooked oat color. As much as 50 ppm Fe(2+) may be found in freshly pumped well water, but Fe(2+) reacts quickly with oxygen and precipitates as Fe(OH)(3).

The variations seemed to depend largely upon genetic differences. In rye, also environmental conditions affected the lignan content through grain size; smaller grains had significantly lower total lignan, syringaresinol, and lariciresinol content than larger grains.

The amino acid contents of OPI are 4.5-8.7 times higher than those of oat flour. The secondary structures of OR have been quantified by the deconvolution of the amide I band of the FTIR spectrum of OPI, which were found to contain approximately 7% beta-turn, 19% alpha-helix, and 74% beta-sheet. Tapping mode AFM results further suggest that the oat protein isolate has two major types of shapes, ellipsoidal and disk-like.

"This study investigates the release of selected strawberry flavor compounds from aqueous solutions of two barley and oat beta-glucan products at concentrations of 5, 10, and 15% (w/w). The flavor release of 12 esters and 3 alcohols was measured by dynamic headspace GC-MS. For each compound the ratio of the flavor release from the beta-glucan solution to the release from aqueous solution, A(rel) was recorded. In general, esters were retained in the beta-glucan matrices in a mass-dependent manner where heavier molecules were retained more. A(rel) for alcohols was found to be significantly larger than for the esters. Whereas A(rel) values for esters were always below unity, this parameter was above unity for alcohols in some preparations of beta-glucan. This implies that relative to esters, alcohols were rejected from some matrices. An increase in the concentration of the beta-glucan products was associated with an increased retention of alcohols and esters. For solutions of oat and barley beta-glucan products at the same concentration, the oat product retained the flavor compounds more strongly. This difference was more pronounced at low concentrations of the beta-glucan products. To investigate the potential of a multivariate approach for the analysis of the flavor release from beta-glucan products, partial least-squares regression was employed on a large selection of calculated molecular descriptors, yielding simple QSPR models capable of explaining the variation in A(rel). The robustness of the QSPR models was verified by cross-validation and permutation tests.

"BACKGROUND: In China, some oat-processing companies use pearling treatment to remove part of kernel lipase activity before further deactivation such as infrared roasting. Kernel size and shape are important physical properties of oat kernels. However, there are no reports concerning the change of oat kernel size and shape and lipase activity during pearling treatment. RESULTS: In this research, we tested lipase activity in the kernels of four different oat varieties and we studied the relationship between kernel size and shape and lipase activity. The effect of pearling treatment on oat lipase activity was also examined. A TM-05C Satake mill was employed to pearl oat samples, with different pearling times ranging from 0 to 45 s at 5 s intervals. The oat lipase activity, lipid content and kernel shape and size after the pearling treatment were tested. Results showed that not only oat variety but also kernel size and shape had marked effects on lipase activity. Pearling treatment could significantly reduce lipase activity. During pearling treatment, small changes in kernel size and shape could cause a dramatic decline in lipase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Pearling treatment could be an effective pretreatment for further deactivation treatment of oats. (C) 2009 Society of Chemical Industry",803,1,1,1,99,1,4,0,0,1,200
"The effects of two different modification methods (deamidation and succinylation) on the functional properties (solubility, water- and oil-binding capacity, foaming capacity and stability, emulsion activity and stability) of oat protein isolates were evaluated. Protein isolates extracted from defatted oat flour at alkaline pH were acylated by 0.20 g/g of succinic anhydride, The protein isolate was also modified using a mild acidic treatment (HCl, 0.5 N). Succinylation and deamidation improved solubility and emulsifying activity of the native protein isolate. Foaming capacity of oat protein isolate increased after deamidation, whereas succinylation decreased it. The deamidated and succinylated proteins had lower foam and emulsion stabilities than had their native counterpart. Water- and oil-binding capacity, in both modified oat proteins, was higher than those of the native oat protein isolate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",804,99,99,99,99,1,1,0,0,4,133
"The phase separation behavior of mixed oat beta-glucans/sodium caseinate and oat delta-glucans/pullulan aqueous dispersions at 20 degrees C has been Studied. The concentration of beta-glucans required for induction of phase separation and the physical state of the separated phases, as revealed by visual observations and dynamic rheometry, depended on the molecular weight of beta-glucans and the initial polymeric composition. For beta-glucans with apparent molecular weights (M,) 35 and 65 x 103 the beta-glucan concentration at which thermodynamic incompatibility occurred decreased from about 2-2.5% (w/w) at low concentrations (similar to 0.2%) of sodium caseinate or pullulan to about 1-1.5% (w/w) beta-glucans at high levels (up to 7.5% w/w) of the second biopolymer; these bi-phasic systems consisted of an upper liquid phase and a lower gel-like phase. For beta-glucans with M-w of 110 x 10(3), a bi-phasic system with two liquid phases appeared above a certain beta-glucan concentration, which decreased from approximately 4% to 1% (w/w) with increasing sodium caseinate levels in the range of 0.2-7.5% (w/w). With further increase in beta-glucan concentration, the lower phase turned into a gel, and at even higher beta-glucan concentrations, the polymer demixing process was 'arrested' by chain aggregation events, leading to a macroscopically single gel phase. Generally, the aggregation of beta-glucans seemed to interfere with the phase separation phenomenon resulting in an increase of beta-glucan concentration in the lower phase between 5% and 110% and only a slight increase of sodium caseinate or pullulan concentration in the upper phase (<10%), due to kinetic entrapment of the polymeric components into a highly viscous medium.

"The isothermal (5 degrees C) equilibrium phase behaviour of high molecular weight oat beta-glucan/whey protein isolate binary mixtures was investigated. The mixtures were studied at different pH values (3.0 and 7.0) in the presence or absence Of Sucrose (10% w/v) by means of phase analysis, electrophoresis, viscosity measurements, and fluorescent microscopy. The mixtures are incompatible in a wide range of concentrations as revealed by phase diagram construction. Decrease of pH from 7.0 to 3.0 and sucrose addition enhances miscibility, and the latter effect is more pronounced at pH 3.0. Viscosity measurements of the mixed systems revealed that flow is pseudoplastic at all concentrations Studied and the behaviour changes from protein- to polysaccharide-controlled as the biopolymer concentration varies in the Mixtures. This is also reflected in the topology of the mixed systems where a transition in the continuity of the microstructure is observed from protein- to bi- to polysaccharide-continuous.

"The use of grains alternative to wheat or rye is a challenging task for cereal technologists, and currently new technologies are under investigation as tools to improve the performances of these alternative grains. In this work the effects of high Hydrostatic Pressure (HP) on oat batters were investigated. Oat batters were treated for 10 min at 200, 300, 350, 400 or 500 MPa. Scanning electron microscopy and bright field microscopy showed that high HP significantly affected oat batter microstructure, and both starch and proteins were affected. Treatment at high HP significantly improved batter viscosity and elasticity. At pressures <= 300 MPa the increase in the viscous component was higher than the increase in the elastic component. On the contrary, at pressures >= 350 MPa the elastic component was predominant. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that high HP induced starch gelatinisation, which started at 300 MPa and was almost complete after treatment at 500 MPa. High HP also affected water- and salt-soluble as well as urea-soluble oat proteins. Analysis of proteins soluble in different buffers revealed that pressures >= 300 MPa induced the formation of urea-insoluble complexes and/or disulfide bonds. Overall, the extent of starch gelatinisation and protein modification was dependent on the applied pressure, but the results collected so far clearly show that high HP can be used to improve the functionality of oat batters.

"11 samples of oats from the 2005 crop of the field experiment carried out in RSD Lipnik were examined. Naked grain oats were represented by a standard Polar cultivar and 5 strains (STH 6102, STH 6856, STH 7146, STH 7256, STH 1692), whereas husked grains were represented by a standard Bohun cultivar and 4 strains (STH 684, STH 688, STH 729, STH 840). The examined naked grain oats differ considerably from husked grain oats in their chemical composition. A statistically significantly higher content of protein (P <= 0.05), a higher level of fat (P <= 0.01) and a lower value of crude fibre (P <= 0.01) were observed in the grains of naked oats compared with the husked grains. The protein of oats is characterised by a favourable amino acid composition of high quality protein which can be confirmed by the EAAI values. The first amino acid limiting the nutritive value of protein was lysine in nearly all oat samples. The characteristic feature of the Polar cultivar was isoleucine deficit. The positive nutritive values for oat grains, in particular those for naked oat grains, make it possible to use them as food for humans and feed for monogastric animals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Objectives: A gluten-free diet omitting wheat, rye, and barley is the only effective treatment for coeliac disease. The necessity of excluding oats from the diet has remained controversial. We studied the toxicity of oats in children with coeliac disease during a 2-year follow-up by investigating jejunal transglutaminase 2 (TG2)-targeted I-A-class autoantibody deposits, a potentially more sensitive disease marker than serum antibodies or conventional histology. Patients and Methods: Twenty-three coeliac children in remission were randomized to undergo oat or gluten challenge with wheat, rye, barley, and oats. When jejunal histological relapse was evident after gluten challenge, patients excluded wheat, rye, and barley but continued with oats. Mucosal morphology and TG2-targeted autoantibody deposits were studied in jejunal biopsies taken at baseline and after 6 and 24 months. Furthermore, serum IgA-class TG2 antibodies were measured. Results: At baseline, serum TG2 antibodies were negative in all 23 patients, but 7 of thetas had minor mucosal deposits. In the oats group, there was no significant change in the intensity of the deposits within 2 years. In contrast, during the gluten challenge, the intensity of the deposits clearly increased and decreased again when wheat, rye, and barley were excluded but consumption of oats was continued; this was in line with serum autoantibodies. The intensity of the mucosal deposits correlated well with both villous morphology and serum autoantibody levels. Conclusions: Consumption of oats does not induce TG2 autoantibody production at mucosal level in children with coeliac disease. Measurement of small-intestinal mucosal autoantibody deposits is suitable for monitoring treatment in coeliac patients. JPGN 48:559-565, 2009.",809,-1,-1,0,1,0,1,2,2,0,257
"Equilibrium dialysis, molecular modeling, and multivariate data analysis were used to investigate the nature of the molecular interactions between 21 vanillin-inspired phenolic derivatives, 4 bile salts, and 2 commercially available beta-glucan preparations, Glucagel and PromOat, from barley and oats. The two beta-glucan products showed very similar binding properties. It was demonstrated that the two beta-glucan products are able to absorb most phenolic derivatives at a level corresponding to the absorption of bile salts. Glucosides of the phenolic compounds showed poor or no absorption. The four phenolic derivatives that showed strongest retention in the dialysis assay shared the presence of a hydroxyl group in para-position to a CHO group. However, other compounds with the same structural feature but possessing a different set of additional functional groups showed less retention. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares regression (PLS) calculations using a multitude of diverse descriptors related to electronic, geometrical, constitutional, hybrid, and topological features of the phenolic compounds showed a marked distinction between aglycon, glucosides, and bile salt retention. These analyses did not offer additional information with respect to the mode of interaction of the individual phenolics with the beta-glucans. When the barley beta-glucan was subjected to enzyme degradation, the ability to bind some but not all of the phenolic derivatives was lost. It is concluded that the binding must be dependent on multiple characteristics that are not captured by a single molecular descriptor.",810,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,233
"Test weight and groat proportion are two very important quality characteristics of oat grain. In this study, we pose the hypothesis that these two characteristics are related through characteristics of grain density. Test weight is defined as the product of kernel density and packing proportion. Groat proportion, in theory, is the ratio of the groat mass to the kernel mass. We present two theoretical constructions expressing test weight in terms of groat proportion, packing proportion and kernel density components. To test these, we have applied measurements of test weight, groat proportion, kernel density components, and packing proportion of 18 oat cultivars grown at six environments. Whereas the groat proportion alone accounted for only 34% of the variation in test weight, our theoretical constructions that included groat proportion could account for <= 82% of variation in test weight. Also, we present previously undescribed variation in oat kernel density components across genotypes and environments. Although the kernel density alone could account for most of the variation in test weight across genotypes, packing proportion appeared to be more important in describing variation in test weight of a genotype across different environments. We observed significant variation in both groat and hull density which, together with groat proportion, described most of the variation in kernel density.",812,99,99,1,99,99,1,0,0,4,211
"Viscous fibers, including beta-glucan in oat bran, favorably affect satiety as well as postprandial carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. However, effects of fiber viscosity on modulation of satiety-related gut hormone responses are largely unknown. We examined the effects of modified oat bran, with or without its natural viscosity, on sensations of appetite and satiety-related gastrointestinal (GI) hormone responses to establish the relevance of viscosity of P-glucan in oat bran. Twenty healthy, normal-weight participants (16 female, 4 male, aged 22.6 +/- 0.7 y) ingested 2 isocaloric (1250 kJ) 300-mL oat bran beverages with low or high viscosity (carbohydrates, 57.9 g; protein, 7.8 g; fat, 3.3 g; fiber, 10.2 g) after a 12-h fast in randomized order. Viscosity of the low-viscosity oat bran beverage was reduced by beta-glucanase treatment. Blood samples wore drawn before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after beverage consumption. The oat bran beverage with low viscosity induced a greater postprandial increase in satiety (P = 0.048) and plasma glucose (P < 0.001), insulin (P = 0.008), cholecystokinin (P 0.035), glucagon-like peptide 1 (P = 0.037), and peptide YY (P = 0.051) and a greater decrease in postprandial ghrelin (P = 0.009) than the beverage with high-viscosity oat bran. Gastric emptying as measured by paracetamol absorption was also faster (P = 0,034) after low-viscosity oat bran beverage consumption. In conclusion, viscosity differences in oat beta-glucan in a liquid meal with identical chemical composition strongly influenced not only glucose and insulin responses, but also short-term gut hormone responses, implying the importance of food structure in the modulation of postprandial satiety-related physiology.

"We have earlier demonstrated that muesli enriched with oat beta-glucan effectively lowered serum LDL cholesterol. Addition of plant stanols further lowered LDL cholesterol. Besides these hypocholesterolemic effects, beta-glucan and plant stanol esters (PSE) may also affect inflammatory processes. Forty-two mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects randomly consumed for 4 wk (crossover design) control muesli (4.8 g control fiber), beta-glucan muesli (4.8 g oat beta-glucan), or combination muesli (4.8 g oat beta-glucan plus 1.4 g stanol as PSE). Changes in cytokine production (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha) of LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and whole blood were evaluated, as well as changes in plasma high-sensitivity (hs)-CPP. Additionally, changes in expression profiles of 84 genes involved in atherosclerosis metabolism were assessed in isolated PBMC. IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha production by PBMC and whole blood after LPS stimulation did not differ between the treatments. Also high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were similar. beta-Glucan consumption did not change gene expression, while only 3 genes (ADFP, CDH5, CSF2) out of the 84 genes from the atherosclerotic risk panel were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) after consumption of PSE.

"Cereal beta-glucans, linked essentially by mixed beta-(1,4/1,3) glycosidic bonds, were extracted, purified, and structurally identified. Previously chemical Structure of barley beta-glucans was characterized from 3 varieties of 'Gang', 'Ohl', and 'Gwangan', and the (1,4)/(1,3) linkage ratio of the beta-glucans was identical. In this study, beta-glucans from 1 barley ('Chal') and 3 oat ('Ohl', 'Samhan', and 'Donghan') varieties were structurally scrutinized, and the linkage pattern of total 7 cereal beta-glucans was compared. The amount of 2 major 3-O-beta-cellobiosyl-D-glucose (DP3) and 3-O-beta-cellotriosyl-D-glucose (DP4) from barley and oat accounted for only 66.6-73.3 and 68.12-81.89% of water-extractable beta-glucan fractions, and the (1,4)/ (1,3) linkage ratios of both barley and oat beta-glucans were within very narrow range of 2.27-2.31 and 2.38-2.39, respectively, among the cultivars tested. Structural difference in the cereal beta-glucans was evident when DP3:DP4 ratio in the beta-glucan structure was compared. As a result, this ratio was significantly greater for barley beta-glucan (2.26-2.74) than for oat (1.54-1.66). Chal-B had the greatest DP3 to DP4 ratio among the samples, which in turn reflected the least amount of (1,4)-linkages.",815,99,0,99,99,1,1,0,1,3,174

"2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidine oxoammonium ion (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation was applied to oat beta-glucans, and the physicochemical and hypocholesterolemic properties of the resulting derivatives were investigated. The C-13 NMR spectra revealed that C6 primary alcohol groups were selectively oxidized into carboxyl groups. The oxidized derivatives exhibited enhanced water solubility and improved in vitro bile acid binding capacity. When hypercholesterolemic rats were fed diets containing the oxidized beta-glucan, the levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and VLDL-C in the rats significantly decreased (p < 0.05), consequently improving the serum lipid profiles. Dietary supplementation with beta-glucans reduced also the total cholesterol level in liver. Furthermore, more fecal eliminations of total cholesterol and triglyceride were observed, which were favorably correlated to their reduced levels in the serum and liver. As a result, oxidized oat beta-glucan exhibits potential use as an active cholesterol-lowering ingredient.",819,1,1,1,99,1,4,0,0,1,136
"Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingested gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet for life. This paper presents a systematic review of the scientific literature on the safety of pure oats for individuals with celiac disease, which historically has been subject to debate. Limitations identified within the scientific database include: limited data on long-term consumption, limited numbers of participants in challenge studies, and limited reporting about the reasons for withdrawals from study protocols. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that a small number of individuals with celiac disease may be intolerant to pure oats and some evidence from in vitro studies suggests that an immunological response to oat avenins can occur in the absence of clinical manifestations of celiac disease as well as suggesting that oat cultivars vary in toxicity. Based on the majority of the evidence provided in the scientific database, and despite the limitations, Health Canada and the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) concluded that the majority of people with celiac disease can tolerate moderate amounts of pure oats. The incorporation of oats into a gluten-free diet provides high fiber and vitamin B content, increased palatability, and beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. However, it is recommended that individuals with celiac disease should have both initial and long-term assessments by a health professional when introducing pure oats into a gluten-free diet.",820,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,241
"The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of soil chemistry on the concentrations of Co, Ni, Zn, Mn, Cu and Fe in oats (Avena saliva L. cv. Fiia) grown on Finnish acid sulphate (AS) soils with varying geochemical characteristics. Twenty two soil profiles, which were sampled to a depth of 1 m (five 20 cm section splits), and 26 composite oat grain samples were collected on a total of five fields. The concentrations of Co, Ni, Zn and Mn in the grains were correlated with the NH(4)Ac-EDTA-extractable concentrations in the soils. However, as these four chalcophilic metals are in general easily lost to drains and not retained as a large pool in the soil in easily-extractable form, also the concentrations in the oats were not in general elevated as compared with average values on other soils. On one of the fields, however, the Co and Ni concentrations in the soil, and thus also in the oats, were clearly elevated. Copper and Fe displayed no correlation between the soil and oat concentrations, indicating that the plant-uptake mechanisms are much more important than variations in geochemistry. It was suggested that the NH(4)Ac-EDTA solution was not efficient in extracting Fe and Cu, which shows that these metals are bound in relatively immobile oxyhydroxides.",821,99,99,99,-1,-1,0,2,0,3,213
"Every year between 2002 and 2005 approximately 100 samples of oats from fields of known agronomy were analysed by GC/MS for 10 trichothecenes: deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol, 3-acetylDON, 15-acetylDON, fusarenone X, T-2 toxin (T2), HT-2 toxin (HT2), diacetoxyscirpenol, neosolaniol and T-2 triol. Samples were also analysed for moniliformin and zearalenone by HPLC. Of the 10 trichothecenes analysed from 458 harvest samples of oat only three, 15-acetylDON, fusarenone X and diacetoxyscirpenol, were not detected. Moniliformin and zearalenone were absent or rarely detected, respectively. HT2 and T2 were the most frequently detected fusarium mycotoxins, present above the limit of quantification (10 mu g kg(-1)) in 92 and 84% of samples, respectively, and were usually present at the highest concentrations. The combined mean and median for HT2 and T2 (HT2+T2) was 570 and 213 mu g kg(-1), respectively. There were good correlations between concentrations of HT2 and all other type A trichothecenes detected (T2, T2 triol and neosolaniol). Year and region had a significant effect on HT2+T2 concentration. There was also a highly significant difference between HT2+T2 content in organic and conventional samples, with the predicted mean for organic samples five times lower than that of conventional samples. This is the largest difference reported for any mycotoxin level in organic and conventional cereals. No samples exceeded the legal limits for DON or zearalenone in oats intended for human consumption. Legislative limits for HT2 and T2 are currently under consideration by the European Commission.

The positive net charge of OPI and the positive or neutral charge of the modified OPI were apparent from the free capillary zone electrophoresis (FZCE) profiles. Acetylation significantly lowered foaming and emulsifying properties of OPI, while succinylation showed the highest foaming capacity, foam stability, and emulsion stability. Acetylated OPI showed the highest surface hydrophobicity compared to the other samples, while OPI was the most soluble of all. The water holding capacity of all samples analyzed was the same except for acetylated-crosslinked (ACXL). The surface tension test confirmed that unmodified and modified OPI possessed surface activity and the equilibrium surface tensions decreased sharply with increasing protein concentration and leveled off to a constant value. The elastic modulus, G', for the acetylated OPI suspension exhibited the highest value, while the G' of the crosslinked (XLOPI) had the lowest.

The addition of oat flour and carrageenan moisture retention, cooking yield, diameter, juiciness, water holding capacity (WHC) texture profile analysis (TPA), color traits, and sensorily acceptance were assessed in cooked and fried kofta. Inclusion of oat flour and carrageenan in the formulation resulted in significant (P 0.05) higher moisture retention and the yield on cooking and frying. There was a significant increase (P 0.05) in diameter in cooked kofta, whereas, a decrease in diameter was noticed for fried kofta as compared to control sample decreased (P 0.05) in fried kofta compared to control (without carrageenan and oat flour). The cooked kofta had a better juiciness than control (P 0.05); however, inclusion of carrageenan and oat flour in the formulation lowered juiciness in fried kofta (P 0.05). Uncooked and cooked meat kofta had higher (P 0.05) WHC than control. Hardness of cooked and fried kofta decreased (P 0.05) and adhesiveness increased (P 0.05) with the increase of carrageenan levels in the formulation.

"During the malting process, storage proteins are degraded by proteolytic enzymes into small peptides and amino acids. The activity of these enzymes was measured during malting of oats and was found to be increased. To quantify proteolytic degradation, proteins of unmalted, germinating and malted grains were fractionated. After extracting the oat proteins (Osborne fractionation), protein fractions were analysed using a Lab-on-a-Chip technique, which separates the proteins - based on their molecular weight - by capillary electrophoresis. This new technique for the analysis of proteins was supported by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In addition, amino acid analysis was carried out. In general a degradation of proteins to small peptides and amino acids could be observed in the globulin, prolamin and glutelin fractions. In the albumin fraction a protein increase was observed, which is due to the fact that this fraction contains the majority of the metabolically active proteins. Amino acid analysis supported the observation of increased protein amount in the albumin fraction and decreased protein amounts in the other fractions. Some proteins, which have not been described in the literature, were detected in the albumin and glutelin fraction, since Lab-on-a-Chip technique allows detection of proteins with low molecular weights of 4.5 kDa.

"The article proves the existence of a strong correlation between the range of parameters of hydrothermal treatment of oat grain (temperature of moistening, steam pressure, time of moistening) and the moisture content of the grain. The study is based on a multidirectional scheme and allows for conducting analysis of the influence of hydrothermal treatment on the physical properties of oat grain, mainly on its moisture content. The results obtained facilitated the elaboration of a scheme for calculating changes in the geometrical center of grain after it is subjected to steam moistening. It explains a complicated mechanism of changes in the geometrical properties of moistened grain and their effect on the bulky array, which is very important in the proper processing and preparation of grain.

"Response surface methodology was used to investigate the impact of germination time and temperature during malting on the quality of oat malt. Significant effects (P < 0.05) of germination time on the activities of alpha-and beta-amylase and proteases were found, whereas beta-glucanase activity was not significantly influenced. Fermentability of Congress mash worts increased with prolonged germination times to maximum values and afterward declined. Although total nitrogen content was not significantly influenced, soluble nitrogen (SN) increased with prolonged germination time. Free amino nitrogen (FAN) was the only analyzed parameter affected by both varied germination conditions. High viscosities and low extract contents remained unaffected by the varied germination parameters. Optimal germination conditions were observed for germination times between 88 and 124 hr at temperatures between 19 and 20 degrees C or at 10 degrees C.

In cookies containing 10-30% C-Trim20, cereal/grain flavor intensity increased with increasing amounts of the hydrocolloid. Cardboard flavor also increased, but no significant differences were noted from the control until 20% replacement. Cohesiveness, density, and moistness of the cookies increased with increasing amounts of C-Trim20 with no significant differences until 20% replacement. Substituting 5% of the oil in the peanut spreads with Nutrim-OB did not significantly affect flavor of spreads. However, 9% substitution significantly decreased oily flavor and hardness increased. The use of 5-13% C-Trim20 as a replacement for oil in the spreads produced significantly more gumminess and hardness than the control. Favor of the spreads was not affected by the substitution of up to 9% C-Trim20. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.",828,0,0,1,99,0,1,0,3,1,212
"A maize bran/oat flour extruded breakfast cereal was developed as a novel source of an antioxidant and complex polysaccharides. Six levels of maize bran/oat flour were formulated (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50%, w/w). The breakfast cereal containing 30% maize bran was the most accepted by consumers. A 100 g serving of this cereal formulation provides 0.2 g of ferulic acid, and 8 g of complex polysaccharides, which includes 1.2 g of beta-glucans and 6.8 g of arabinoxylans. This cereal breakfast could be an alternative to maize bran, which is a by-product scarcely used for human consumption. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",830,1,0,99,99,1,2,0,1,2,105
"Enzymatic pretreatments of oat bran, using viscozyme L to enhance protein extraction, were investigated. To obtain the best possible combination of enzymatic pretreatment variables including viscozyme L concentration, incubation time, pH and incubation temperature for maximum protein extraction, modern optimization techniques were employed. The optimization procedure included two stages: creating a response surface model through regression on experimental data and then optimizing the model by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. The optimum conditions of enzymatic pretreatment were: viscozyme L concentration, 30 FBG/10 g of oat bran; incubation time, 2.8 h; pH 4.6; and incubation temperature, 44 degrees C. Under such conditions, the predicted maximum protein extracted was 55.69%, which coincided with the experimental values. These results indicated that enzymatic pretreatment can improve protein extraction significantly and PSO algorithms were efficient approaches for optimizing the conditions of enzymatic pretreatment of oat bran.

"The levels and compositions of a range of phytochemicals (sterols, tocols, avenanthramides, folates, phenolic acids) and dietary fiber components were determined in five oat cultivars (four husked and one naked) grown on a single site in 2005. The total levels of tocols, phenolic acids, and avenanthramides varied by over 2-fold between cultivars, but less variation occurred in total sterols and total folates. Limited variation was also observed in the dietary fiber content and composition of the four husked lines. These results indicate that it may be possible to selectively breed for lines with high contents of dietary fiber and specific groups of phytochemicals.",832,1,1,99,0,99,2,0,1,2,103
"In order to assess the effect of heat treatment procedure on the flavor and volatile compounds of oats, raw oats, kiln and dried oats, dehulled oats and oat flakes were analysed. A sensory profile method was used to monitor changes in flavor. It changed from hay-like for raw oats into nutty, bread-like for oat flakes. Headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) and solvent assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE) techniques were applied for isolation of aroma compounds. The most abundant compound in headspace was hexanal - its concentration varied from 176 to 1671 mu g/kg depending on the processing stage. The key aroma compounds of oat flakes identified using gas chromatography - olfactometry and aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) were 2-methyl-3-furanthiol with roast/cooked oatmeal flavor together with methional, dimethyl trisulfide, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-methyl-3,5-diethylpyrazine.

Whole oat flour obtained by hammer milling was fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum along with white flour and bran in order to compare the suitability of these substrates for the production of a probiotic beverage. The three substrates show a viable cell concentration at the end of fermentation above the minimum required in a probiotic product. The highest cell concentration was observed in white flour (9.16 Log(10) CFU/mL) and the lowest in the bran sample (8.17 Log(10) CFU/mL). (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"This study evaluated the effect of adding oat fibre source of beta-glucan (13.45%) on physical, chemical, ;microbiological and sensory traits of low-fat (<10%) beef patties as compared to 20% fat control patties. Significant (p < 0.05) improvements in cooking yield (74.19%), and retentions of fat (79.74%) and moisture (48.41%) of low-fat patties were attributed to the water binding ability of beta-glucan. Because of larger water retentions moisture contents of raw and cooked low-fat patties were higher (p < 0.05) than those of the control patties. Cholesterol content was similar across formulations. Low-fat and control beef patties remained stable in microbiological quality during 60 days frozen storage. Low-fat patties were found to be of lower degree of likeness in the taste but juicer than control (p < 0.05). Besides appearance, tenderness and colour were not affected by the addition of oat's soluble fibre. Oat fibre can be used successfully as a fat substitute in low-fat beef patties.

", with beta-glucan concentrations of 8.7 and 4.9%, respectively, were used to determine the impact of dry solids (DS) and bile acid (BA) concentrations on in vitro BA binding efficiency. A full fractional factorial design with levels for BA concentrations of 0.20, 0.47, 0.95, 2.37, and 4.73 mu mol/g of total EBC slurry and for DS in the slurries of 0.8, 2, 3, and 4% (w/w) was selected. The absolute amount of BA bound (mu mol) was measured for each trial in the experiment design. The percentage (%) of BA bound based on the total amount of BA added and BA bound per gram of DS of the EBC (mu mol/g) were also presented and discussed. N979 in vitro digestion slurries had greater BA binding (umol) than Jim slurries at different DS and BA concentrations, with greater differences at DS of 3% or above and at BA concentrations of 2.37,mu mol/g or above. No difference in the absolute amount of BA bound (umol) and percentage (%) BA bound occurred between the EBC slurries made from the two oat types at the lowest DS of 0.8% or the lowest BA concentration of 0.20 mu mol/g. The efficiency of BA binding by beta-glucan in these two EBC became more distinguishable at 3% DS or above and BA concentrations of 2.37 mu mol/g or above, indicating that these two conditions can be employed to measure BA capacities for similar foods. Also, the beta-glucan in the EBC produced from the N979 oat line was more soluble than that from the EBC produced from the Jim oat line. Thus, greater BA binding capacity may have been caused by both a greater amount of beta-glucan and a greater solubility of beta-glucan in N979 than in Jim EBC.",836,99,0,1,99,99,1,0,1,3,291
"Oil quality and content were analyzed in 33 accessions from 13 wild species and 10 accessions of cultivated oat. Wild oat species tended to have higher oil and 18:1 fatty acid (FA) contents and lower amounts of 18:2 and 18:3 FAs as compared to cultivated oats. In addition to common FAs, minor amounts of several hydroxy and epoxy FAs were also present in the oat oil and mainly confined to specific lipid classes. These unusual FAs included the previously reported 15-hydroxy 18:2(Delta 9,12) (avenoleic acid) mostly found among polar lipids and a novel 7-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid located to 1,2-diacylglycerol. The present study highlights the potential of making use of the existing germplasm, consisting of wild oat species, in breeding programs for achieving new oat varieties that produce a range of oils with different FA compositions as well as having high oil contents. However, in one matter, oats apparently lack genetic diversity and that is for oil qualities that are highly enriched in the omega 3 (omega-3) FA 18:3. Consequently, developing oat cultivars with highly unsaturated oils will need involvement of other techniques such as biotechnology.",837,0,99,1,0,99,1,0,2,2,184
"Avenanthramides (avn) ire antioxidant compounds found in oat tissues, including the grain, that are of interest front a nutritional standpoint. In this study. we have measured avenanthramide concentration in the grain of 18 oat genotypes grown in six environments. These genotypes varied widely in crown rust (Puccinia coronata) resistance. Crown rust infected two of the six environments studied. The grain avenanthramide concentrations in the crown rust environments were significantly higher than those in the uninfected environments. Avenanthramide concentrations in the crown rust infected environments was also significantly correlated with their genetic crown rust resistance, as evaluated in the field. These results suggest that avenanthramide accumulation in the grain is associated with crown rust infection and that, in most of the cultivars evaluated, the extent of their accumulation also correlated with their genetic disease resistance avenanthramide accumulation in the grain was, with noted exceptions, highest in those cultivars showing the greatest genetic resistant to crown rust.",838,99,1,1,99,99,2,0,0,3,155
"Test weight or bulk density of oats (Avena sativa L.) has a major influence on the monetary value of oat grain. We hypothesize that test weight can be attributed to grain density and packing efficiency. We have measured oat grain volume and density by a sand-displacement method and derived the packing factor for six oat cultivars grown in three environments. Volumes of individual grains were 31-38 mm(3) and were highly correlated with grain mass. Grain densities were 0.96-1.03 g/cm(3). Packing efficiency. defined as the space proportion occupied by the grains, was 53-55%. Regression analysis suggested that 78% of the variation in test weight could be attributed to grain density. Size fractionation of grain by sieving and analysis by digital image analysis indicated that smaller grains within an oat sample packed more efficiently than larger grains and larger grains in a sample were less dense than the smaller grains. Analysis of oat grain components indicated groat densities were approximate to 1.29 g/cm(3) and hull densities were approximate to 0.69 g/cm(3). The difference in densities between groat and hull provide a physical basis for the recognized relationship between groat percentage and test weight.",839,-1,99,1,1,99,2,1,0,2,191
"The soluble fiber, beta-glucan, in oat products is an active hypolipidemic component that is responsible for lowering plasma lipids. Quantitative analysis of beta-glucan in oat hydrocolloids such as Oatrim, Nutrini, and C-Trim was performed to measure the total beta-glucan content and molecular weight distribution. For the measurement of total beta-glucan content, both modified flow-injection analysis (FIA) method and the standard AACC enzymatic method were employed. FIA method uses the enhanced fluorescence produced when beta-glucan forms complexes with Calcofluor. Experimental results of both the modified FIA method and the standard AACC enzymatic method revealed very good coincidence with each other. This result confirms the applicability of either technique for the quantitative evaluation of beta-glucan in hydrocolloids. Molecular weight (MW) distribution of beta-glucan was determined by size-exclusion chromatography with postcolumn detection. Experimental results revealed that the molecular weight of beta-glucan in the Trim products was decreased during the manufacturing process. This result was ascribed to the rigorous processing condition of jet-cooking.",840,99,1,99,99,1,2,0,0,3,159
"Background Several factors can affect glycemic and insulinemic responses from cereal foods. Some suggested factors lowering the responses are; intact botanical structure, high amylose/high ss-glucan cereal varieties, organic acid produced during fermentation and food processes inducing retrogradation of starch. Aim of the study To evaluate the impact of fermented whole grain cereal kernels with high content of amylose (40%) and/or beta-glucan (4.6%) on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in healthy adults. Methods Thirteen healthy volunteers (4 men and 9 women) were given 25 g available carbohydrate portions of: glucose solution; tempe fermented whole-grain barley and tempe fermented whole-grain oat. Blood samples were collected directly before the meal (fasting) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the start of the meal. The GI (glycemic index) and II (insulin index) of meals were calculated for each subject according to FAO/WHO standards. Results Peak glucose response was lowest after the tempe meal with high-amylose/ high-ss-glucan barley tempe while insulin response was lowest after the meal with high beta-glucan oat tempe. The mean blood glucose responses for both the barley and the oat tempe meals were significantly lower than from the reference glucose load (P < 0.0001) during the first 60 min. The calculated GI:s for barley and oat tempe were 30 and 63, respectively. Mean serum insulin responses from barley and oat tempe were significantly lower compared with the glucose load (P < 0.002) during the first 60 min, and the calculated II was lower for oat tempe (21) compared with barley tempe (55). Conclusions The results suggest that cereal products with beneficial influence on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses can be tailored by fermentation and enclosure of high-amylose and/or high-beta-glucan barley and oat kernels.",841,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,286
"Rolled oats, a processed oat product, contain about 4 g of (1 -> 3),(1 -> 4)-beta-glucan (beta-glucan) per 100 g. It also contains 27.0 mg of ferulic acid and 3.5 mg of p-coumaric acid. Moreover, the presence of (beta-glucan, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid was confirmed in commercial food products with rolled oats in their lists of ingredients. The radical scavenging activity of a water-soluble polysaccharide fraction (WS) extracted from rolled oats was examined and components involved in this activity were evaluated. This WS exhibited radical scavenging activity and a strong correlation (r=0.9982) was observed between this activity in terms of the ferulic acid equivalent and WS sample concentration. Concerning the neutral sugar composition of the WS, glucose accounted for about 49 mol%, followed by xylose (about 28 mol%) and arabinose (about 15 mol%). In addition, ferulic acid was contained in a macromolecular fraction collected by gel-filtration chromatography of lichenase-treated WS. Therefore, arabinoxylan containing ferulic acid may be a component leading to the radical scavenging activity of the WS.",842,99,0,99,0,99,0,0,2,3,169
"Product quality is an important determinant of consumer acceptance. Consistent oat flake properties are thus necessary in the mill as well as in the marketplace. The effects of kilning and tempering conditions (30, 60 or 90 min at 80, 95 or 110 degrees C) on flake peroxidase activity, size, thickness, strength and water absorption were therefore determined. After kilning, some peroxidase activity remained but steaming and tempering effectively destroyed the activity of these enzymes. Thus the supposed protective effect of kilning or groat durability was not confirmed. Kilning resulted in an increase in flake specific weight, but no other significant effect on flake quality was observed. Tempering time and temperature interacted significantly to produce complex effects on flake specific weight, thickness and water absorption. Flake thickness and specific weight were significantly correlated (r = 0.808, n = 54). Longer tempering times resulted in an increased fines' fraction, from 1.45% at 30 min to 1.75% at 90 min. It is concluded that whilst kilning has little effect on flake quality, the heat treatment immediately prior to flaking, can be used to adjust flake quality independently of flake thickness.",843,0,1,99,1,0,2,0,2,1,187
"Samples from three different oat (Avena sativa L.) cultivars, Vista, Gem and Dane were steeped and germinated in a pilot plant malting system. The content of avenanthramides, antioxidant compounds unique to oats, and some unknown compounds as well as the activities of the avenanthramide-synthesising enzyme hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: hydroxyanthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HHT) and the avenanthramide-oxidizing enzyme phenoloxidase (PO) were measured. An increase in avenanthramide content of germinated seeds, as compared to raw grains, was observed for Dane (125%, p < 0.001) and for Vista (29%, p = 0.007). The HHT activity increased 62% (p = 0.014) in Dane, whereas no change was detected in Vista and Gem. The PO activity decreased slightly during the germination process for Gem (p < 0.001) and Vista (p = 0.005). Many of the unknown compounds increased significantly during germination in all three cultivars, and one of them was identified to be the avenanthramide N-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy-(E)-cinnamoyl)-5-hydroxy-4-methoxyanthranilicacid.

"Background/Objective: Carboxylic acids (CAs), especially butyric acid, have been suggested to counteract colonic diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. Colonic formation of CAs can be influenced by the diet, but the concentrations and pattern formed need to be evaluated for different food products in humans. To elucidate how the colonic concentration of CAs in healthy subjects is influenced by dietary supplementation with oat bran, and whether the concentration varies over time and during consecutive days. Subjects/Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects ( age 24 +/- 1.3) were recruited to the study. The subjects were given 40 g beta-glucan enriched oat bran per day, corresponding to 20 g dietary fibre, in 4 slices of bread. CAs were analysed in faeces during three consecutive days after 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks on this diet. Results: The concentration of acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acid was higher (P<0.05-0.001) after 8 weeks on the oat bran diet as compared with values at entry, whereas that of lactic acid was lower (P<0.05).After 12 weeks, the concentrations of acetic, propionic and isobutyric acid were still higher and that of lactic acid lower. The variation between individuals was considerable, whereas in the same individuals there was little variation. Conclusions: Oat bran increased the faecal concentration of CAs after 8 weeks, indicating an increased concentration also in the distal colon. The concentration of all main acids increased, except for lactic acid, which decreased. Oat bran may therefore have a preventive potential adjunct to colonic diseases.",845,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,2,0,249
"Objective: Products enriched with oat beta-glucan have been shown to reduce postprandial glucose and insulinemic responses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an extruded muesli product based on oat beta-glucan on the rate of gastric emptying, postprandial blood glucose and satiety in healthy subjects. Methods: Gastric emptying rate (GER) was measured by standardized real-time ultrasonography. Twelve healthy subjects were assessed using a randomized crossover double blind trial. The meals were administered after 8 hours' fasting after measuring the subject's normal fasting blood glucose level. Blood glucose measurements were made before. 30 and 60 min after the end of the meal. Satiety scores were estimated 15 and 90 min after the end of the meal. The GER was calculated as the percentage change in the antral cross-sectional area 15 and 90 minutes after ingestion of vanilla yoghurt with muesli containing 4 g oat beta-glucan (GER1) or vanilla yoghurt with muesli containing cornflakes (GFR2). Results: The median values were 60% for GER1 and 44% for GER2. The effect of 4 g oat beta-glucan on the rate of gastric emptying was not statistically significant compared with corn flakes. Muesli with 4 g oat beta-glucan lowered the postprandial glucose response significantly compared to the cornflakes meal (p = 0.045). The effect of oat beta-glucan on satiety was not statistically significantly. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that intake of muesli with 4 g oat beta-glucan does not affect the gastric emptying rate or satiety but lowers the postprandial blood glucose response. indicating that the GER does not regulate the blood glucose level.",846,1,0,1,0,1,3,0,2,0,264
"The effects of Trametes hirsuta laccase and Pentopan Mono BG xylanase and their combination on oat, wheat, and mixed oat-wheat doughs and the corresponding breads were investigated. Laccase treatment decreased the content of water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) in oat dough due to oxidative cross-linking of feruloylated arabinoxylans. Laccase treatment also increased the proportion of water-soluble polysaccharides (WSNSP) apparently due to the beta-glucanase side activity present in the laccase preparation. As a result of the laccase treatment, the firmness of fresh oat bread was increased. Xylanase treatment doubled the content of WEAX in oat dough and slightly increased the amount of WSNSP. Increased stiffness of the dough and firmness of the fresh bread were detected, probably because of the increased WEAX content, which decreased the amount of water available for P-glucan. The combination of laccase and xylanase produced slight hydrolysis of P-glucan by the P-glucanase side activity of laccase and enhanced the availability of AX for xylanase with concomitant reduction of the amount and molar mass of WSNSP. Subsequently, the volume of oat bread was increased. Laccase treatment tightened wheat dough, probably due to cross-linking of WEAX to higher molecular weight. In oat-wheat dough, laccase slightly increased the proportion of WSNSP between medium to low molecular weight and increased the specific volume of the bread. Xylanase increased the contents of WEAX and WSNSP between medium to low molecular weight in oat-wheat dough, which increased the softness of the dough, as well as the specific volume and softness of the bread. The results thus indicate that a combination of laccase and xylanase was beneficial for the textures of both oat and oat-wheat breads.",847,99,99,99,0,99,0,0,1,4,270
"A reliable method for the determination of T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin in different cereals, including oats, as well as in cereal products was developed. After extraction with methanol/water (90/10, v/v) and dilution with a 4% NaCl solution, the toxins were purified with immunoaffinity columns, derivatized with 1-anthroylnitrile, separated by HPLC, and determined using fluorescence detection. Due to the unspecific derivatization reagents, validation parameters were matrix dependent: in the range 10-200 mu g/kg, recovery rates of 74-120% with relative standard deviations between 0.5 and 20.3% were obtained. On average, the limit of quantitation was shown to be 8 mu g/kg for each toxin. For naturally contaminated samples, comparable results were obtained when analysis was performed according to this method without derivatization as well as according to a method based on a SPE cleanup utilizing tandem mass spectrometric detection in both cases. Using aqueous acetonitrile as extractant resulted in incorrectly high toxin concentrations due to water absorption of dry samples and toxin accumulation in the organic phase in the subsequent phase separation of the extractant. Furthermore, when comparing the commercially available immunoaffinity columns for T-2 and HT-2 toxins, significant differences regarding capacity and cleanup performance were observed.",848,99,-1,-1,0,99,0,2,1,2,196
"Puffed oat cakes were prepared by puffing the extruded oat pellets with a rice cake machine using independent variables of extrudate moisture contents (30 and 34%, wb), tempering moisture content (10, 12, and 14%, wb), heating temperature (238, 243, 249, and 254 degrees C), and heating times (4, 6, and 8 sec). All four processing variables had significant effects on oat cake physical properties (specific volume, color, hardness, and integrity). Heating time had the most significant effect. Increasing heating time resulted in oat cakes with increased specific volume, integrity, and redness but lower lightness and yellowness. An acceptable product could be made using oat pellets extruded at either 30 or 34% moisture, dried to 9%, and then tempered to 12-14% moisture, and heated to 243-254 degrees C for 8 sec.

"An experiment was conducted to determine whether adding oat hulls to weaner pig diets based on extruded rice or unprocessed wheat influenced post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD) and protein fermentation in the large intestine. Ninety-six male piglets (5-16 (SEM 0.08) kg) were allocated to (i) extruded rice plus animal proteins (RAP); (ii) RAP with added oat hulls (20 g/kg); (iii) wheat plus animal proteins (WAP); (iv) WAP with added oat hulls (20 g/kg). Blood and faecal samples were collected on days 7 and 14 after weaning at about age 21 d. Pigs fed RAP had]note PWD than pigs fed WAP (P < 0.05). Oat hull supplementation to diet RAP decreased the incidence of PWD (P < 0.05). The total-tract digestibility of DM, starch and energy was higher in rice-based diets than in wheat-based diets (P < 0.001); however, oat hulls decreased digestibility of DM and gross energy (P < 0.001). Pigs fed RAP had higher plasma creatinine concentrations (P < 0.01), which were positively correlated to cumulative beta-haemolytic Escherichia coli scores after weaning (R-2 0928; P=0.015). Addition of oat hulls decreased plasma urea concentrations only in pigs fed RAP (interaction; P < 0.05). Pigs fed RAP had lower faecal total biogenic amine concentrations than pigs fed WAP (P < 0.001). Oat hull supplementation tended to decrease total biogenic amine concentrations (P=0.103). These data indirectly suggest that a mostly insoluble dietary fibre source such as oat hulls can decrease PWD in dietary situations where there may be a misbalance of carbohydrate to protein entering the hindgut.",850,1,1,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,253
"Oat bran concentrate (OBC) was defatted by supercritical carbon dioxide, pin-milled and air-classified into five fractions (< 15, 15-18, 18-24, 24-30 and > 30 mu m). beta-glucan content (% dry weight) of defatted OBC, its subsequent pin-milling and the air-classified fractions in ascending particle size was 14.3, 17.0, 4.3, 5.8, 12.6, 14.7 and 22.4, respectively. High-performance size-exclusion chromatography equipped with multi-angle laser-light scattering and refractive index detectors showed that amylopectin was the predominant molecule present in all OBC powders but was present in greater concentration in fractions collected that were < 24 mu m. Fractions > 24 mu m, which had the highest beta-glucan contents had higher starch gelatinisation temperatures (measured using differential scanning calorimeter), and had substantially higher peak, breakdown, final and setback paste viscosity (measured using Rapid Visco Analyser, Foss North America, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) compared with the other lower-beta-glucan containing fractions. No differences in water retention of 25% (w/w) oat powders in water (measured using thermogravimetric analyser) were observed among defatted OBC, its subsequent pin-milling and the five fractions separated by air-classification.

"Objective: To evaluate the impact of an extruded muesli product based on beta-glucan-rich oat bran on postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia. Subject/Design: The study is divided in two series. Blood glucose and serum insulin responses were studied after subjects consuming test meals including a serving of muesli with 3 g (series 1) and 4 g (series 2) of beta-glucans, respectively. The muesli was a component in a single serving packet with muesli and yoghurt. This was served together with white wheat bread in the morning after an overnight fast. The compositions were standardized to contain 50 g available carbohydrates. As a reference meal a serving packet without b-glucans was included. The study was performed at Applied Nutrition and Food Chemistry, Lund University, Sweden. Nineteen and thirteen healthy volunteers with normal body mass index were recruited for series 1 and 2, respectively. Results: Muesli with 3 g of beta-glucans, included in a mixed bread meal, gave no significant differences in glycaemic response compared to a reference meal without muesli and beta-glucans. In contrast, muesli with 4 g of beta-glucans significantly (P < 0.05) lowered the glucose and insulin responses compared to the reference meal. Conclusions: Muesli enriched with 4 g of beta-glucans reduces postprandial glucose and insulin levels to a breakfast based on high glycaemic index products. A total of 4 g of beta-glucans from oats seems to be a critical level for a significant decrease in glucose and insulin responses in healthy people.",853,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,242

Most effective temperature during microwave irradiation for maximising extraction of PC and AC was 150 degrees C. Defatted OBC in 50% ethanol and MI at 150 degrees C extracted greatest PC and AC. SCD treatment slightly reduced PC and AC. OBC extracted in water or 50% ethanol at 22 degrees C without microwave irradiation had similar PC and AC than OBC MI at 150 degrees C, but much higher levels were observed for latter heat treatment using absolute ethanol. Air-classification shows potential to enhance PC and AC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",854,0,0,99,-1,99,0,1,2,2,161
"Effects of chop length (shorter: 6 mm, or longer: 19 mm) of alfalfa silage and oat silage were determined in 16 mid-lactation Holstein cows, 4 of which were rumen cannulated, using a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with a 2 x 2 arrangement of treatments. Experimental periods were 21 d long and consisted of 14 d of adaptation and 7 d of sampling. Cows received a total mixed ration containing [dry matter (DM) basis] 42.0% barley grain-based energy supplement, 10% protein supplement, and 24% of DM longer chop or shorter chop alfalfa silage and 24% of DM longer chop or shorter chop oat silage. Rumen pH was measured continuously, and rumen liquid flow rates were determined in rumen-cannulated cows. Feeding behavior was determined by videotaping, and meal patterns were determined by continuously weighing the feed in the bunk of 8 cows. Reducing the chop length of alfalfa silage and oat silage reduced the average geometric particle length from 14.2 to 10.9 mm and from 13.4 to 10.4 mm, respectively. Reducing the alfalfa chop length did not affect feed intake, whereas reducing the oat silage chop length increased DM intake from to 19.4 to 21.2 kg/d. Reducing the chop lengths of alfalfa silage and oat silage chop length did not affect milk production, rumen fermentation, feeding behavior, meal patterns, and blood metabolites. Daily milk yield, milk fat percentage, and milk protein percentage averaged 36.1 kg/d, 3.00%, and 3.16%, respectively, across diets. The low milk fat percentages suggest that the diets induced subacute ruminal acidosis. This was also substantiated by the rumen pH, which was below 5.6 for more than 122 min/d for all diets. The onset of subacute ruminal acidosis despite apparently adequate dietary neutral detergent fiber content and particle size distribution as well as the long duration of chewing might be attributed to sorting against long feed particles.",855,-1,99,99,99,0,0,1,1,3,310
"Novel qualitative as well as semiquantitative rapid strip tests for screening of T-2 mycotoxin in agricultural commodities were developed. Colloidal gold particles were coated with monoclonal anti-T-2 antibodies and used as detector reagent, indicating the strip test results by formation of up to two colored lines in a competitive assay format. The test line comprises a protein conjugate of the T-2 mycotoxin and the control line an antispecies-specific antibody to confirm the correct test development. To perform the test, 5 g of sample was extracted in a ratio of 1:5 with methanol/water (70:30) by shaking for 3 min and the extract directly used without further cleanup steps. The T-2 toxin lateral flow device (LFD) presented has a cutoff level around 100 mu g/kg for naturally contaminated wheat and oat. The semiquantitative test may be used in the lower micrograms per kilogram range and allows for rapid semiquantitative photometric classification of the level of sample contamination. For both tests, results were obtained within 4 min. The developed LFDs therefore allow for the first time fast and on-site screening for the determination of T-2 toxin in cereals.",856,0,99,1,99,-1,1,1,1,2,185
"China is a major producer of oats; the annual harvested area of 350,000 ha yields approximately 465,000 tons, giving an average yield of 1.33 tons/ha. The bran is not used for animal feed as it is of poor digestibility and low nutritive content and is considered a waste byproduct. Therefore, it is advantageous to produce a value-added product from the bran. We extracted the native polysaccharide, a linear (1-3)-, (1-4)-linked beta-glucan (OBG) from the oat bran and synthesized a sulfated derivative OBGS containing 36.5% sulfate. OBGS had potent activity against a primary isolate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells at a concentration (EC50 = 5.98 x 10(-4) mu M) approximately 15,000 times below its cytotoxic concentration. OBGS was also active postinfection (EC50 = 5.3 x 10(-4) mu M) and protected pretreated peripheral mononuclear cells (EC50 = 5.2 X 10(-2) mu M) washed free of the compounds prior to infection. Thus, OBGS has potential as a vaginal microbicide and is the first such report for oat bran derived sulfatea beta-glucan.",857,1,-1,1,0,0,2,1,2,0,173
"Wheat waste stands for one of the most important cereals both in view of its nutritive value and its high waste volume, although the latter is not considered among the most polluting source of wastes. However, it is of great importance to optimise the conversion of wheat, barley and oat waste into useful materials such as biomass, biogas/biofuel, animal feed and composting. Advantages and disadvantages and effectiveness per method (incineration, combustion, composting) are summarised by means of six comprehensive tables and six figures. It appears that the method with the greatest potential is the one aiming at conversion of wheat waste into biomass or biogas in view of the energy problems and the extended pollution of the environment due to release of carbon dioxide.",858,99,99,99,-1,-1,0,2,0,3,124
"This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of partial replacement (50% level) of butter fat by two different fat replacers (avocado puree and Oatrim) on the physical, textural and sensory properties of oatmeal cookies. Compared with the control cookie, both fat-reduced cookies had greater heights, reduced spreads, increased % moisture loss and higher water activities (P < 0.05). Textural measurements made using the TA.XT Plus Texture Analyzer showed the fat-reduced cookies to be tougher and less brittle (P < 0.05). Appearance was the only sensory category in which a significant difference was seen (P < 0.05).

"Oat bran muffins, containing 4 or 8 g of beta-glucan per two-muffin serving, were prepared with or without beta-glucanase treatment to produce a range of beta-glucan molecular weights from 130,000 to just over 2 million. Following an overnight fast, the glycemic responses elicited by the untreated and treated muffins was measured in 10 healthy subjects and compared with a control whole wheat muffin. Taken all together, the 4-g beta-glucan/serving muffins reduced blood glucose peak rise (PBGR) by 15 +/- 6% compared with the control. The 8-g beta-glucan/serving muffins had a significantly greater effect (44 5% reduction compared with the control, P < 0.05). The efficacy of the muffins decreased as the molecular weight was reduced from a 45 6% reduction in PBGR (P < 0.05) for the untreated muffins (averaged of both serving sizes) to 15 +/- 6% (P < 0.05) for muffins with the lowest molecular weight. As the molecular weight was reduced from 2,200,000 to 400,000, the solubility of the P-glucan increased from a mean of 44 to 57%, but as the molecular weight was further decreased to 120,000, solubility fell to 26%. There was a significant correlation (r(2) = 0.729, P < 0.001) between the peak blood glucose and the product of the extractable P-glucan content and the molecular weight of the beta-glucan extracted.",861,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,217
"Research interest in oats has focussed on their nutritional value, but there have been few studies of their food processing. Heat treatment is characteristic of oat processing, as it is needed to inactivate lipase and to facilitate flaking. A Texture Analyser was used to characterise the mechanical properties of unkilned and kilned oat groats after steaming and tempering in an oven for 30, 60 and 90 min at 80, 95 and 110 degrees C. Maximum force, number of peaks before maximum and final force after 5s hold were used to characterise the behaviour of the groats during compression. Kilned groats were larger and softer before steaming. After steaming and tempering, the moisture content of the kilned groats was higher than for unkilned groats. Hot, steamed oats were softer than cold, unsteamed groats, indicated by a decrease in maximum force from 59 to 55 N, and there was no significant difference between kilned and unkilned groats. However, higher temperatures during tempering increased maximum force. These results suggest that mild steam treatment yields softer oat groats, whereas cold or over-treated groats tend to be harder.

"This paper describes the binding of Calcofluor, a fluorescent probe, to oat P-glucan in buffer solutions. The binding equilibrium constant (K), the total number of binding sites per beta-glucan molecule (M, and the average binding number of Calcofluor per beta-glucan molecule (n) were determined by UV spectroscopic method. The results indicate that the association of Calcofluor and P-glucan is driven by both enthalpy and entropy and that the process involves hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interaction. Higher buffer concentration and NaCl facilitate the binding of Calcofluor to P-glucan. The adsorption isotherm fits a Langmuir model quite well.",863,1,99,1,99,99,2,0,0,3,100
"Background/ Aims: To investigate whether a daily intake of a nutrient-balanced ready meal containing 4 g of oat beta-glucans lowers total cholesterol (T-C) and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in hyperlipidemic subjects and to evaluate its effect on postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. Methods: A parallel, placebo-controlled trial was carried out in 43 healthy men and women with elevated serum cholesterol levels. During the 3-week run-in period, all subjects consumed daily a ready-meal soup, low in energy and fat and high in fiber but without oat beta-glucans. Subjects were then randomly assigned for the following 5-week intervention period to either continue consumption of the control soup or an equal soup supplemented with beta-glucan. Results: Consumption of the beta-glucan-enriched ready meal decreased T-C (0.22 +/- 0.41 mmol/l) and LDL-C (0.16 +/- 0.36 mmol/l), but the reductions were not significantly lower compared with control. After a meal with beta-glucan soup, neither postprandial glucose nor insulin concentrations were significantly different from those after a control soup. Conclusion: A daily dose of 4 g of oat beta-glucans incorporated into a healthy ready meal did not significantly lower T-C and LDL-C compared with an equal ready meal without beta-glucans. Thus, if a food product fulfils general healthy dietary recommendations it may not necessarily be a candidate for supplementation with beta-glucans. Copyright (C) 2008 S.

"The antioxidant activity, total phenolic and beta-glucans contents, and the fatty acid profile of total lipids in covered (black and yellow) and naked oats were studied. Oats with black hulls showed a significantly higher antioxidant activity in 2,2'-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate] (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) based tests in comparison to the grains with yellow hulls and those of the naked varieties. Radical scavenging activity of oats determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)/spin-trapping test did not depend on the colour of the grain hulls, but the naked grains showed a lower ability in scavenging reactive radicals. A positive correlation between the content of beta-glucans in covered oat grains and the amount of reactive radicals scavenged was observed. Total phenolic content in the black oats was significantly higher than in the yellow and naked oat varieties. However, no significant differences in the fatty acid profile between the naked and covered oats were found, and the common fatty acids being linoleic, oleic, and palmitic acids.",865,0,0,0,1,-1,1,1,3,0,160
"A precise design of the equipment for thermal sterilisation of rice, potato starch, and oat flakes by dry heat requires the knowledge of the relevant values of physical properties of these products. Water activity and enthalpy are presented as functions of temperature and humidity. Water activity was measured as a function of the moisture content and temperature in the desorption process that reproduces the real conditions existing during dry heat processing in the pilot rotating steriliser equipment. The heat of evaporation can be predicted from these data as a function of the moisture content of these products. DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) method was used for measuring the enthalpy of these products as a function of temperature during desorption of moist products starting from various levels of the moisture content.

"The study investigated enzymatic pretreatment of oat bran, using Viscozyme L to enhance protein extraction. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to study the effects of pretreatment variables of Viscozyme L concentration (6-30 FBG), pH (3.0-5.0), incubation time (0.5-2.5 h) and temperature (35-55 degrees C) on protein extraction from oat bran. The results indicated that the generated regression model represented the relationship between the independent variables and the responses. Protein extraction from oat bran was mainly affected by pH and incubation temperature. From the RSM-generated model, the optimum conditions of enzymatic pretreatment were identified as Viscozyme L concentration 30 FBG/10 g of oat bran, pH 4.6, incubation time 2.8 h and temperature 44 degrees C. Under the optimum conditions, the predicted protein extracted from oat bran was 55.7%, whereas, the experimental extracted protein was 56.2%. The RSM-predicted and experimental extracted proteins were not significantly different from each other. The enzymatic pretreatment method under the optimum conditions extracted significantly more protein (56.2%) than did the alkaline (pH 9.5) method (14.76%). Viscozyme L pretreatment of oat bran improved protein extraction. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",867,99,0,1,0,99,1,0,2,2,184
"Avenanthramides are unique components of oats (Avena sativa L.) that are described as phytoalexins and that have potential health promoting properties. The objectives of this study were to examine the avenanthramide contents and the activity of the avenanthramide biosynthetic enzyme hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:hydroxyanthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HHT) in spikelets and leaves of developing field-grown oats and to examine the presence of avenanthramides in unelicited seedling leaves of oats raised in a growth chamber. Avenanthramides were evident in spikelets of field-grown plants within 3-5 days after heading, and they generally increased in concentration throughout maturation. HHT activity was not detected until 21-22 days after heading, but the activity increased with age in most cultivars. In leaves, avenanthramides were evident before heading and generally increased in concentration until about 15 days after heading. At maturity, the concentrations of avenanthramides in spikelets were generally higher than in leaves. Seedling leaves from controlled environments that were not exposed to elicitors had low concentrations of avenanthramides at 7 days after planting, which increased in one cultivar, but not in another, over the next 14 days. These results indicate that unelicited seedling leaves contain avenanthramides, i.e. that avenanthramides are constitutively present in both grains and leaves. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"The solution properties of beta-glucan isolated from whole grains of oats and barley were studied by viscosity and oscillatory measurements both in water and in aqueous cuoxam, an ammoniacal Cu(OH)(2)/CUCl-solution. The viscosity measurements of water solutions show stronger shear thinning for oat than for barley beta-glucans. The crossover points of the moduli G' and G '' in cuoxam solutions were different for the two beta-glucans, i.e. 10 Hz for oat beta-glucan and 1.5 Hz for barley beta-glucan. The molecular weights of the beta-glucans were similar. Therefore, the difference in solution properties seems to be related to the difference in structure. This difference is revealed by the ratio DP3:DP4 of the main building blocks of beta-glucans, which was higher for barley than for oat beta-glucan.

This paper reports the effect of an oat beta-glucan on rheological properties Of set yoghurts. The skim milk powder (SMP) and whey protein isolate (WPI) powders were used in order to increase the amounts of total solids in the examined set yoghurts. The hardness of set yoghurts increased at a higher oat beta-glucan content upon replacement of SMP with WPI. Hardness increased to an optimal beta-glucan concentration and then a phase separation was observed. Similar tendency was observed for the viscosity of an oat beta-glucan treated yoghurt. At higher oat beta-glucan concentration the extensive phase separation phenomenon occurred between milk proteins and polysaccharide. A faster increase in storage and loss moduli was observed when beta-glucan contained yoghurt was incubated. Oat beta-glucan can be successfully applied in the process of yoghurt production.,871,1,99,99,1,99,2,0,0,3,131
"This work was aimed at decreasing the glycaemic index (GI) of white wheat bread. Breads made with wheat flour (WF) or wholemeal flour (WMF) and fermented with baker's yeast had similar values of resistant starch (RS; 1.4-1.7%, starch basis). Sourdough Lactobacillus plantarum P1 and Lactobacillus brevis P2 favoured the highest formation of RS (approximately 5%) when fermented with WF and WMF. The mixture (1: 1) of WF and WMF (WF/WMF) was selected. The effect of dietary fibres, chemical or sourdough acidification on the hydrolysis index (HI) of WF[WMF bread was determined. Among fibres, only the addition of oat fibre (5%) decreased the HI to 90-84%. Lactic acid determined the lowest HI and the effect was related to the decrease of pH. For the same decrease of pH, breads fermented with L. plantarum PI and L. brevis P2 (sourdough WF/ WMF) showed values of HI lower than chemical acidification. The glucose response and GI of WF bread or sourdough WF/WMF bread enriched with oat fibre was determined by using fifteen healthy volunteers. Anhydrous glucose was used as reference. The area under the glucose response curve and the value of GI (72%) of WF bread were significantly (P<0.05) higher than sourdough WF/WMF bread enriched with oat fibre (GI = 53.7%). The decrease of GI of the sourdough WF/WMF bread may be due to both fibre content and decreased pH. Compared to WMF bread, sourdough WF/WMF bread, enriched with oat fibre, had higher specific volume, better cell crumb structure and more appreciated acidulous smell, taste and aroma.",872,99,99,1,1,1,3,0,0,2,254
"Morphology, starch structures and thermal and pasting properties of oat bran concentrate (OBC) and Nutrim-OB (NOB), a jet-cooked oat bran product, with or without supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (SCD) were studied. Oil composition was analysed. OBC had three thermal transitions, starch gelatinisation and two amylose-lipid complex transitions. NOB only had amorphous amylose-lipid transition. SCD significantly decreased gelatinisation temperatures of OBC. Pasting properties, showed NOB had significantly higher peak viscosity and breakdown, with significantly lower final viscosity, setback and pasting temperature compared with OBC. SCD increased peak viscosity for NOB and final viscosity for OBC. Thermogravimetric analysis showed NOB had higher water-holding capacity (WHC) than OBC, while SCD decreased WHC. Amylopectin molecular weight was 3.4 x 10(8) for OBC and was significantly lower for NOB (1.4 x 10(8)). Predominant fatty acids were oleic (41%), linoleic (38%) and palmitic (16%).

"Objective: Soluble dietary fiber has been shown to attenuate the postprandial rise in blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This effect seems to be related to its theological properties including viscosity. We examined the intra-fiber variability between two different processing methods of concentrating beta-glucan from oats (aqueous vs. enzymatic) in relation to the level of viscosity of beta-glucan and its effect on postprandial glycemia in healthy individuals. Design: In an acute, randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 11 healthy subjects (gender: 5M:6F; age: 34 5 years; BMI: 23 0.8 k g/m(2)) were randomly assigned, on three separate occasions, to consume one of three fiber-matched treatments along with a 75g oral glucose drink. The enzymatically processed P-glucan (Oat-A) differed from P-glucan processed through the aqueous method (Oat-B) solely with regard to viscosity. Finger-prick capillary blood samples were obtained at fasting and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the start of the test drink. The viscosities of the fiber drinks were determined (Paar Physica UDS200 viscometer). Results: Rheological measurements demonstrated that Oat-A had a significantly higher viscosity than Oat-B and control at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min (p < 0.001). The incremental area under the glucose curve (AUC on Oat-A was 19.6% and 17% lower than that of Oat-B and control, respectively (P < 0.01). Conclusions: This study shows that processing oat beta-glucan through enzymatic, rather than by aqueous methods, preserves the viscosity and improves postprandial glycemic control.",874,99,1,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,248
"Among cereals, oats are known to be very frequently contaminated with type A trichothecenes and so they can play a major role in the exposition of the consumer to these mycotoxins. Seventy representative oat samples of both conventional and organic production were drawn at mills and at wholesale stage according to Commissions Regulation (EC No 401/2006 and analyzed for nine type A trichothecenes by LC-MS/MS. High contamination rates were found for most of the toxins in conventional as well as in organic products (e.g. 100% for T-2 toxin or 99% for HT-2 toxin). The nican concentration of T-2/HT-2 (sum of the toxins) was 17 18 Vg/kg (mean SD) in all samples, 27 21 mu g/kg in conventional, and 7.6 +/- 4.6 mu g/kg in organic products, respectively. The highest T-2/HT-2 level has been determined in conventionally produced oat flakes (85 mu g/kg). The mean level of T-2 tetraol (9.5 +/- 7.7 mu g/kg) in all samples was found to be even higher than that of T-2 (5.1 +/- 6.0 mu g/kg), whereas levels of T-2 triol, 4,15-diacetoxyscirpenol, 15-monoacetoxyscirpenol, and neosolaniol were considerably lower.

"One oat cultivar grown in Idaho (three field sites) was pin-milled and separated by sieving to investigate whether starch from oat bran differs from the remainder of kernel. Ground oat particles were classified into three sieve fractions: 300-850 mu m, 150-300 mu m and < 150 mu m). beta-Glucan content in sieve fractions was analyzed and starch was extracted from kernels without milling and from kernels of each sieve fraction. (beta-Glucan contents of 300-850, 150-300, and < 150 mu m sieve fractions were 4.2, 2.3, and 0.8%, respectively. Therefore, starch in bran (300-850 mu m sieve fraction) and endosperm (< 150 mu m sieve fraction) were separated. Starch isolated from entire kernels had significantly higher apparent and absolute amylose content than starch from the 300-850 mu m sieve fraction. Starch from different sieve fractions was not significantly different in the apparent amylose, absolute amylose, amylopectin molecular weight, gyration radii, starch gelatinization, and amylose-lipid complex thermal transition temperatures. Starch from the 150-300 mu m sieve fraction had significantly lower peak, final, and setback viscosity compared with the starch isolated from the 300-850 mu m and < 150 mu m sieve fractions. Starch removed from the oat bran fraction during beta-glucan enrichment may have different applications compared with starch obtained from other kernel compartments. Because pin-milling decreased apparent amylose content and shortened amylopectin branch chains, its potential to alter starch structure should be considered.",876,99,99,99,0,99,0,0,1,4,232
"Oat and barley beta-glucans were isolated from their respective concentrates that were prepared through a novel technology, containing total phosphorus at 0.920 and 0. 170%, w/w, respectively. The highest purity of oat and barley beta-glucans achieved was 97 and 90%, w/w (db), respectively. Purified oat and barley beta-glucans contained 21.8 and 54.1%, w/w, respectively, of the total phosphorus present in the corresponding beta-glucan concentrates. On a weight basis, the total phosphorus content in purified oat and barley beta-glucans was 0.201 (degree of substitution (DS) = 0.011) and 0.092% (DS = 0.005), respectively. P-31 NMR of both types of beta-glucans showed the presence of inner C-6 carbon bound phosphomonoesters and an unknown form of phosphorus, possibly phospholipids and/or phosphoproteins. In addition to these phosphorus forms, barley beta-glucan sample contained pyrophosphate for which the origin was unknown. Although a substantial amount of phytate phosphorus (0.745 and 0.103%, w/w, for oat and barley, respectively) was present in both types of beta-glucan concentrates, this form of phosphorus was absent in the purified beta-glucan as evidenced by P-31 NMR data. Aqueous extractability of oat beta-glucan from purified sample at 37 degrees C was 6.6-fold higher than that of barley beta-glucan at the same temperature. This may partly be attributed to the presence of more (46%) negatively charged phosphorus substitution in oat beta-glucan than in barley. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"An innovative oat dry processing, integrating pearling, dry milling and sifting, has been developed. The benefits of applying pearling included the production of bran-rich fractions enriched in specific bran layers and their corresponding chemical constituents, removal of trichomes and harmful surface-borne compounds such as aluminium, and microbial decontamination of pearled oat groats. The surface-borne trichomes of an Expression oat cultivar contained at least 126 ppm aluminium and were inhabited by at least three strains of bacteria up to a population of 380000 colony forming units per gram of trichomes. A pearling process of 5 s depilated all trichomes, resulting in the complete removal of aluminium and bacteria from pearled oat groats. Chemical analysis of the bran-rich fractions (referred to as pearlings) revealed irregular distributions of minerals and protein, while moisture and starch contents increased with the amount of pearlings removed. Phosphorus analysis in the pearlings indicated that a pearling time interval from 20 to 50 s generated a fraction enriched in aleurone material to a level of 24%. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"A dry milling strategy has been developed for separating oats into bran-rich and starch-rich fractions. For the first time, this process combined the benefits of oat pearling with the efficiency of break and reduction milling and sifting to allow production of flour and bran fractions from an oat cultivar of high lipid content. The bran-rich fraction complies with the separation ratio and chemical composition of the AACC's definition for oat bran. Oat cultivars with a lipid content below 10% (db) can be dry milled by the process developed in this study. The roll disposition, roll gap and the speed differential of the corrugated and smooth rolls together with the aperture size of the sieves for flour separation were the important parameters that determined the milling and separation efficiency of this oat dry milling process. Critical settings of these parameters included a roll disposition of dull to dull, a roll gap of not larger than 0.1 mm, and a sieve aperture size of 212 mu m for flour separation. A pearling step as short as 5 s prior to roller milling effectively removed all the trichomes from the surface of two cultivars of naked oats.

"The objective of the present investigation was to study the impact of wheat and oat polysaccharides provided as rolls with contrasting dietary fibre characteristics on ileal digesta and portal and arterial plasma glucose concentrations. The diets were offered as baked rolls to eight pigs fitted with a T-shaped cannula for total collection in a crossover design and to four portal vein- and mesenteric artery-catheterised pigs. Ileal digesta were collected at 2 h intervals during an 8 h sampling period and portal and arterial blood at 10 min intervals from -10 min up to 120 min and then at 30 min intervals up to 240 min post-feeding. There was substantial variation in the flow of ileal digesta during the 8 h sampling period, but the flow was more uniform when feeding the oat rolls compared with the wheat rolls. Carbohydrates were the predominant ileal constituent, with most of them present as non-starch polysaccharides and with starch in both diets almost completely digested at the end of the small intestine. Ingestion of the two diets was followed by a rapid rise in postprandial glucose concentration but with no significant difference in either portal or arterial glucose concentration pattern between the two diets. The recovery of glucose in the portal vein up to 240 min after feeding represented 47-64% of consumed starch. Cellulose, resistant starch and arabinoxylans were almost completely recovered at the ileum, while there was a substantial loss of mixed linkage (1 -> 3)(1 -> 4)-beta-D-glucan.

"Experimental (N979-5-2-4 and IA95111) and traditional oat lines (Jim and Paul) with average %beta-glucan of 7.5, 7.8, 4.9, and 4.4%, respectively, were grown in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Molecular weight (MW) distributions of the beta-glucans were examined for potential variations among growing years and for relationships with pasting properties measured by Rapid ViscoAnalyser under three separate conditions: 1) in silver nitrate (SN) solution to inactivate enzymes; 2) hydrolyzed by alpha-amylase to eliminate the effect of starch; and 3) treated with lichenase to remove beta-glucan. The beta-glucan was extracted by a process involving multiple precipitation and dialysis steps, and the MW distributions were determined by HPLC. %beta-Glucan in N979-5-2-4 and IA95111 lines were consistently and significantly greater (P < 0.05) than in Jim and Paul lines during three growing years. The contribution of P-glucan to peak viscosity on the RVA was substantially greater than that of the starch for all three years. The molecular number average and peak MW of beta-glucan from N979-5-2-4 and IA95111 were greater than these values for Jim and Paul, and values were consistent among years. The MW of extracted P-glucan was associated with pasting properties after amylase hydrolysis, but not after treatment with lichenase or in SN solution.",881,99,1,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,202
"The viscosity of soluble fibers such as beta-glucan depends on their concentration in solution and molecular weight (MW) distribution. We investigated whether freezing treatment of oat bran muffins affected the physicochemical properties of beta-glucan, and its physiological effectiveness in lowering postprandial blood glucose response. A controlled range of P-glucan solubility was achieved by subjecting oat bran muffins containing two levels of beta-glucan to repeated freeze-thaw temperature cycling. (beta-Glucan solubilized by in vitro digestion extraction was measured by flow-injection analysis. MW distributions of P-glucan were analyzed using size-exclusion chromatography. beta-Glucan solubility decreased as the number of freeze-thaw cycles increased, while MW distribution of beta-glucan decreased slightly. Peak blood glucose rise (PBGR) after fresh muffins (8 and 12 g of (beta-glucan/serving) was significantly lower than that after muffins (8 and 12 g of beta-glucan/serving) treated with four freeze-thaw (FT) cycles (1.84 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.31 +/- 0.1 mmol/L, P = 0.007). Compared with the control whole wheat muffins, the reduction in incremental area under the glucose response curve (AUC) after fresh muffins (8 and 12 g of (beta-glucan/serving) was nearly twice that after 4 FT cycles (43.3 +/- 4.4% vs. 27.0 +/- 5.4%, P = 0.016). A significant inverse linear relationship was found between the log [concentration] of extractable P-glucan and PBGR (r(2) = 0.85, P = 0.01), and AUC (r(2) = 0.71, P = 0.03). The results show that reduction of P-glucan solubility in foods attenuates its physiological effectiveness in lowering postprandial glycemia.",882,1,1,-1,99,1,3,1,0,1,242
"This randomized, crossover study compared the effects of consuming high-fiber oat and wheat cereals on postprandial metabolic profiles in healthy men. Twenty-seven subjects received oat (providing 5.7 g/day beta-glucan) or wheat (control) cereal products, in random order, incorporated into their usual diets for two weeks. Total energy and fiber(similar to 14 g/day) contents of the cereals were matched. Ameal tolerance test that included the study cereal and a high-fat milkshake (1240 kcal, 105 g fat) was performed at the end of each treatment period. Postprandial insulin and glucose responses over 10 hours did not differ between treatments. Peak triglyceride concentration was lower after oat vs. wheat cereal consumption [2.3 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- standard deviation) vs. 17.6 +/- 8.6 hours x mmol/L, p = 0.068). The free fatty acid area under the curve was elevated after the oat vs. the wheat products (3.64 +/- 0.91 vs. 3.38 +/- 0.98 hours x mmol/L, p = 0.018). These results suggest that high-fiber oat cereal influenced postprandial triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, which may have implications regarding cardiovascular disease risk.",883,-1,1,-1,1,1,3,2,0,0,178
"Oat-based beverages enriched with vitamins and minerals were produced with common hydrothermal treatments and stored at 22 degrees C for 64 weeks. The effects of decanting on the retention of native vitamins, minerals and fatty acids, and different UHT holding time (5 s or 20 s) at 140 degrees C on vitamins were investigated. Fatty acid profile, vitamin retention and dissolved oxygen concentration were monitored during storage. The decanting process caused a 47% increase of vitamin 136 and a 45-74% loss of phosphorus, zinc, calcium and iron. The steam-injection UHT treatment caused a 60% loss of vitamin D-3 for both holding times and a 30% loss of vitamin B-12 for 20 s. During 1 year of storage, oleic and linoleic acids were stable, whereas linolenic acid decreased only slightly, even in the iron-enriched variety. The dissolved oxygen concentration increased to a low value of 0.71 mg L-1 and reached a balance after 16 weeks. Most enriched vitamins except vitamins A, D-3 and B-12 were stable during ambient storage. Oat-based beverages with highly retained vitamins can be manufactured by adding vitamins prior to direct UHT treatment with a shorter holding time. Additionally, iron enrichment of such beverages, without affecting the fatty acid profile, can be achieved by filter sterilisation. (C) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.",884,1,1,1,0,99,3,0,1,1,214
"Objective: To study whether oat bran with native b-glucans increases bile acid excretion and bile acid synthesis as measured by serum concentrations of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7 alpha-HC). Design: Short-term interventional crossover study evaluating cholesterol absorption, ileal excretion of cholesterol and bile acids, and serum levels of cholesterol and bile acid metabolites. Differences between diets evaluated with Wilcoxon's signed rank-sum test. Setting: Outpatients at a metabolic-ward kitchen. Subjects: Nine volunteers with conventional ileostomies. Methods: Two 3-day-diet periods, with controlled, blinded basal diet including 75 g extruded oat bran breakfast cereal daily, with either 11.6 g native or hydrolysed b-glucans. Results: Native oat bran increased median excretion of bile acids by 144% (P = 0.008). Cholesterol excretion remained unchanged, cholesterol absorption decreased by 19% (P = 0.013), whereas the sum of bile acid and cholesterol excretion increased by 40% (P = 0.008) compared with hydrolysed oat bran. 7 alpha- HC reflecting bile acid synthesis increased by 57% (P = 0.008) within 24 h of consumption, whereas serum lathosterol concentration reflecting cholesterol synthesis increased by 12% (P = 0.015). Conclusions: Oat bran with native b-glucans increases bile acid excretion within 24 h of consumption and this increase can also be detected by rising serum concentrations of 7 alpha- HC. Thus, 7 alpha-HC could be used for rapid detection of dietary effects on bile acid metabolism. These effects could possibly be explained by entrapment of whole micelles in the gut owing to higher viscosity.",885,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,2,0,240
"Oat cultivar AC Vermont was malted to concentrate antioxidants, milled to fractionate only the endosperm portion and extracted with methanol to isolate the crude antioxidants. The oat malt antioxidant fraction was assessed as a natural antioxidant based upon enhancing the stability of corn oil against oxidation and compared to the synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The induction time (time required for the formation of 10 meq hydroperoxide per kilogram corn oil thermally oxidized) was used to measure antioxidant activity of oat antioxidant or BHT. The protection factor achieved by crude oat malt antioxidant extract concentrate at 0.26% (2,600 mu g/g) was comparable to BHT (75 mu g/g). The antioxidant activity of the oat and barley malt extract concentrates was not significantly different. However, the extract concentrate of oat malt had 44% less color compared to that of barley malt at equal concentrations showing its potential as a natural food antioxidant.",886,1,1,99,1,1,4,0,0,1,150
"In vitro fermentabilities of the oat flour digestion residues (ODR) from two commercial oat lines with 4.7 and 5.3% beta-glucan and from two high-beta-glucan experimental lines with 7.6 and 8.1% beta-glucan were evaluated and compared with fermentations of lactulose, purified oat beta-glucan (POBG), and purified oat starch (POS). Substrates were fermented by using an in vitro batch fermentation system under anaerobic conditions for 24 h. The progress of the fermentation was studied by following the change in pH of the fermentation medium, production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and gases, and consumption of carbohydrates. The substrate from the flour with the greatest amount of beta-glucan tended to have the greatest pH decline and the greatest total SCFA production. A significant correlation occurred between gas production and SCFA formation (R (2) = 0.89-0.99). Acetate was produced in the greatest amounts by all of the substrates except POBG, by which butyrate was produced in the greatest amount. More propionate and butyrate, but less acetate, were produced from high-beta-glucan ODR. With the given fermentation conditions, > 80% of the total carbohydrate was depleted by the bacteria after 24 h. Glucose was the most rapidly consumed carbohydrate among other available monosaccharides in the fermentation medium. Overall, the high-beta-glucan experimental lines provided the best conditions for optimal in vitro gut fermentations.",887,99,0,1,1,99,2,0,1,2,216
"Objective: To assess the effects of consuming foods containing oat beta-glucan on blood pressure, carbohydrate homeostasis and biomarkers of oxidative stress. Design: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Setting: The trial was conducted at two clinics. Subjects and interventions: Ninety-seven men and women with resting systolic blood pressure 130-179mm Hg and/ or diastolic blood pressure 85-109mm Hg were randomly assigned to consume foods containing oat beta-glucan or control foods for 12 weeks. Resting blood pressures, insulin and glucose values before and after standard breakfast meals, and four biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured before and at the end of the treatment period. Results: Changes from baseline to week 12 in mean peak insulin and incremental area under the insulin curve differed significantly between groups (P = 0.037 and 0.034, respectively), with the beta-glucan group showing declines and the control group remaining essentially unchanged. Blood pressure responses were not significantly different between groups overall. However, in subjects with body mass index above the median (31.5 kg/m(2)), both systolic (8.3 mm Hg, P = 0.008) and diastolic (3.9mm Hg, P = 0.018) blood pressures were lowered in the beta-glucan group compared to controls. No significant differences in biomarkers of oxidative stress were observed between treatments.

"The consumption of polyphenols is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Avenanthramides (AV), alkaloids occurring only in oats, may have anti-atherosclerotic activity, but there is no information concerning their bioavailability and bioactivity in humans. We characterized the pharmacokinetics and antioxidant action of avenanthramide A, B, and C in healthy older adults in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover trial with 1-wk washout periods. Six free-living subjects (3 mol/L, 3 F; 60.8 +/- 3.6 y) consumed 360 mL skim milk alone (placebo) or containing 0.5 or 1 g avenanthramide-enriched mixture (AEM) extracted from oats. Plasma samples were collected over a 10-h period. Concentrations of AV-A, AV-B, and AV-C in the AEM were 154, 109, and 111 mu mol/g, respectively. Maximum plasma concentrations of AV (free + conjugated) after consumption of 0.5 and I g AEM were 112.9 and 374.6 nmol/L for AV-A, 13.2 and 96.0 nmol/L for AV-B, and 41.4 and 89.0 nmol/L for AV-C, respectively. Times to reach the C-max for both doses were 2.30, 1.75, and 2.15 h for AV-A, AV-B, and AV-C and half times for elimination were 1.75, 3.75, and 3.00 h, respectively. The elimination kinetics of plasma AV appeared to follow first-order kinetics. The bioavailability of AV-A was 4-fold larger than that of AV-B at the 0.5 g AEM dose. After consumption of 1 g AEM, plasma reduced glutathione was elevated by 21 % at 15 min (P <= 0.005) and by 14% at 10 h (P <= 0.05).

"Central to commercial oat (Avena sativa L.) processing is impact dehulling. During impact dehulling, oats are fed into a spinning rotor that expels the grains against an impact ring. The impact frees the groat from the hulls. To optimize dehulling protocols, we examined the effects of physical grain characteristics and rotor speed on oat dehulling using an impact dehuller. We separated grain of three cultivars (Gem, CDC Dancer, Ronald) according to size by sieve fractionation (separation by width), disk fractionation (separation by length), and by gravity table (separation by density). Grains were characterized by mass, digital image analysis, and bulk density. Samples (50 g) were adjusted to 9% moisture and dehulled at four different rotor speeds. Groat percentage, dehulling efficiency, and groat breakage were measured after dehulling. In general, oats with higher bulk density dehulled more efficiently at slower rotor speeds, regardless of grain mass. Groat breakage increased with rotor speed and with grain mass. Adjusting dehulling conditions according to grain size improved groat yields over optimal dehulling conditions for unfractionated grains for some cultivars. More refined fractionation of grain according to bulk density may provide further improvement of groat yield during impact dehulling.",890,0,0,99,99,99,0,0,2,3,194
"Oat bran fermentation (OBF) is used to produce non-dairy yogurt-type products. Such products may be designed being rich in probiotic bacteria and/or dietary-fibre. Oat bran is, however, also rich in proteins, especially 12 S globulins. Understanding the behaviour of globulins in OBF would thus offer a basis for further exploitation of proteins in the product design. The behaviour of oat globulins was monitored during a model OBF in order to study changes in protein solubility and possible protein hydrolysis. Proteins were extracted from OBF samples with a buffered and a non-buffered extraction procedure. The extracts were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and a Lowry assay. Combined effect of pH and NaCl-concentration on the solubility of oat globulin isolate was studied. The solubility of oat globulins decreased during OBF; this appeared as their shift from the salt-soluble fraction to the residual protein fraction. The shift in oat globulin solubility was due to the acidifying conditions present in OBF, which lead to the unfolding of globulins and also apparently induced protein aggregation. No major protein hydrolysis was observed during OBF.",891,99,0,0,1,99,1,0,2,2,176
"C-trim30, a new beta-glucan-rich hydrocolloid containing 32% beta-glucan, was obtained by steam jet-cooking and fractionating oat bran concentrates. It was then incorporated into batter formulations to investigate the rheological effects of C-trim30, which were correlated with batter attributes. In steady shear measurements, the use of C-trim30 led to the increase in batter viscosity, while it did not show significant effects on the shear-thinning pattern of batters. Moreover, the increase in the dynamic viscoelastic properties was observed with more contribution to elastic properties because of the high water-holding properties of C-trim30. These rheological characteristics could be correlated with the adhesive properties of batters to a food matrix. In addition, C-trim30 was shown to produce a sample with increased batter pickup, less moisture loss, and reduced oil content. Even, the oil content was reduced by up to 40% when 4% C-trim30 was used in the batter formulations. The combined effects of elevated viscosity, great batter pickup, and reduced moisture loss by the use of C-trim30 contributed synergistically to the reduction of oil content in fried foods.",892,99,1,0,99,1,2,0,1,2,174
"Oat is promoted as a low-glycaemic index food. Our aim was to measure the effect of the fat content of oat in glycaemia and insulinaemia and compare it with the effect of wheat. The study design was a double-blind, randomised cross-over study with four treatment segments. Eight healthy males attended four study sessions in which porridge made from four different raw materials was consumed: rolled oat (O), defatted rolled oat (DO), rolled whole wheat (W) or rolled whole wheat with added oat fat (WF). Available carbohydrate content was analysed enzymatically, and was adjusted to 50 g in each test meal. Fat content per meal was either 6.1 g (O, WF) or approximately 1.9 g (W, DO). Venous plasma glucose, insulin and triacylglycerol concentrations were measured at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min. All products caused a rapid increase in glucose with a peak at 30 min, where W and WF were significantly higher than O (0 = 0.006). Also insulin peaked at 30 min (no differences). A 4.2 g difference in fat content between O and DO or W and WF did not result in any significant differences in their glycaemia or insulinaemia. W and O did not differ in their overall glycaemic or insulinaemic responses. The removal of two-thirds of oat fat did not affect the postprandial plasma triacylglycerol concentration. The present study shows that neither the glycaemic nor the insulinaemic response to rolled oat is affected by the fat content, and that rolled wheat differed from rolled oat in terms of peak glucose concentration only.",893,-1,99,0,0,1,1,1,2,1,259
"A novel oat-based biorefinery producing L(+)-lactic acid and various value-added coproducts (e.g., beta-glucan, anti-irritant solution) is proposed. Pearling is employed for sequential separation of bran-rich fractions for the extraction of value-added coproducts. Lactic acid production is achieved via fungal fermentation of Rhizopus oryzae on pearled oat flour. Maximum lactic acid concentration (51.7 g/L) and starch conversion yield (0.68 g/g) were achieved when an oat flour concentration of 116.5 g/L was used. Oxygen transfer played a significant role with respect to lactic acid production and starch conversion yield. Rhizopus oryzae produced a range of enzymes (glucoamylase, protease, phosphatase) for the hydrolysis of cereal flour macromolecules. Enzyme production during fungal fermentation has been reported. The proposed biorefining strategy could lead to significant operating cost reduction as compared to current industrial practices for lactic acid production from pure glucose achieved by bacterial fermentations.",894,99,99,-1,0,99,0,1,1,3,140
"Background Iron deficiency in children is a major worldwide nutritional problem. An oat beverage was developed for 1- to 3-year-old children and different treatments were used to improve the iron bioavailability. Aim of the study To investigate the effects of citric acid addition, phytase treatment and supplementation with different iron compounds on non-heme iron absorption in human from a mineral-supplemented oat-based beverage. Method A 240 g portion of a Fe-55-labeled test product (T) or a Fe-59-labeled reference dose (R) was served as breakfast after overnight fasting on four consecutive days in the order of TRRT. On day 18 the retention of Fe-59 was measured by a whole-body counter and the erythrocytes uptake of Fe-55 and Fe-59 by a liquid-scintillation counter. Forty-two healthy subjects (men and women) were randomized into four study groups, members of each being given one of the studied four products (A, B, C, and D) supplemented with Fe (1.3 mg/portion), Zn, Ca, Se and P. Ferric ammonium citrate (FeAC) was added to products A, B, and C and ferric pyrophosphate (FePP) to product D. Citric acid (60 mg/portion) was added to products B, C, and D and phytase treatment applied to products C and D. Results Citric acid improved iron absorption by 54% from 3.9% in product A to 6.0% in product B (p = 0.051). Phytase treatment increased iron absorption by 78% (from 6.0 to 10.7%, p = 0.003) by reducing the phytate-phosphorus content per portion from 16.3 mg in product B to 2.8 mg in product C. The two compounds gave similar iron absorption rates (p = 0.916). Conclusion A combination of citric acid addition, dephytinization and iron supplementation significantly increased the iron absorption in an oat-based beverage. Such a beverage can be useful in the prevention of iron deficiency in 1- to 3-year-old children.",895,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,300
"Factors affecting consumers' willingness to use beverages and ready-to-eat frozen soups containing oat beta-glucan were studied in Finland, France and Sweden (N = 1157). Three beverage or soup samples were presented to each consumer: a reference sample without beta-glucan/health claim, a sample containing beta-glucan, without claim and a third one with beta-glucan and claim (cholesterol or glucose related). Questions about liking, beneficiality, willingness to use and price estimates for purchasing were asked before and after tasting. A trained sensory panel (N = 11) also profiled the sensory characteristics of the samples. Taste of the samples strongly affected the willingness to use them. Health claim gave a significant but small added value to beverages and soups with beta-glucan. The price respondents were willing to pay for the beverages and soups containing beta-glucan decreased after tasting, regardless of the health claim. No notable effect due to gender or age on the willingness to use products with health claims was found. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",896,99,99,0,0,-1,0,1,2,2,165
"Adsorption isotherms of oatmeal biscuit (convective-baked and microwave-baked) and oat flakes were determined using a gravimetric static method at 5, 20, 40 and 60 degrees C (relative humidity range 0.03-0.96). The oatmeal biscuits and oat flakes exhibited Type III and II behaviour, respectively, with the sorption capacity decreasing with increasing temperature. The Ferro-Fontan model provided the best description of the experimental sorption behaviour, followed by the Guggenheim-Anderson de Boer equation. Differential enthalpy showed a power law relation with moisture content, with differential entropy also decreasing with increasing moisture content. The linear relation between differential enthalpy and entropy confirmed the existence of compensation. Spreading pressure increased with increasing water activity and decreasing temperature. Net integral enthalpy decreased with increasing moisture content. However, net integral entropy increased with moisture content, but was negative with respect to the entropy of water.

"Pasting properties of oat hydrocolloid-enriched products with 12% oat bran concentrate (OBC), 20% beta-glucan enriched hydrocolloid (BGE-OH20) or 30% (BGE-OH30) beta-glucan content were studied under different temperature conditions using a Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) of 8% (w/w) oat suspensions in water. A typical starch RVA profile was compared with lower heating rates, lower maximum temperature, shorter holding times at maximum temperature, and slower cooling rates. No significant differences were observed in pasting proper-ties of the oat hydrocolloid products heated up to 95 degrees C at different rates using a typical starch RVA profile. OBC breakdown and setback viscosity were observed only at 95 degrees C. At 75 and 85 degrees C, BGE-OH30 had significantly higher final and setback viscosity. BGE-OM20 heated upto 95 degrees C at 2 degrees C/min had significantly higher peak and breakdown viscosity than at 4 degrees C/min. BGE-OH30 pastes had higher peak, trough, breakdown, final and setback viscosity than BGE-OH20 pastes held at 75 or 85 degrees C for 0-5.5 min. Significant differences between BGE-OH20 and BGE-OH30 were observed for final and setback viscosity of pastes cooled from 95 degrees C to 50 degrees C at 2 degrees C/min, 4 degrees C/min or 6 degrees C/min, with lower viscosity at 2 degrees C/min cooling rate. Differences observed in pasting properties could be attributed to P-glucan content or extent of P-glucan starch interactions. Based on our findings, we recommended studies of OBC pasting properties should use a typical starch RVA profile involving heating to 95 degrees C and P-glucan-enriched oat hydrocolloid products ( >= 20%) should use RVA profile with maximum temperature of 75 to 85 degrees C, has short holding time (2 min) and cooling rate of 6 degrees C/min.",898,99,0,-1,0,99,0,1,2,2,284

The results indicated that the NIRS technique can accurately predict the fibre composition of oat hulls. Statistical analysis of variance underlined the strong impact of cultivar on the accumulation of fibre components, whereas location generally played a minor role. The largest variability among cultivars was observed in ADL content, whereas the range of variation in NDF and ADF contents appeared to be reduced.

"Low fat sausages were prepared with added hydrated oatmeal or tofu as texture-modifying agents at levels of 10%, 15%, and 25% (w/w), respectively. The effects of the type and level of texture-modifying agents on the physical and sensory properties of low fat sausages were investigated. The water-holding capacity in sausage products increased by increasing the hydrated oatmeal level, but no significant differences was observed by the addition of tofu. The higher level of the agents produced a sausage product with less cooking loss and with a softer texture. The moisture absorption measurements suggest that the decrease in hardness of oatmeal-added sausage products may be due to the higher water-retention properties of oatmeal in response to heat treatment, while that of tofu-added sausage products may be associated with a weaker internal structure of tofu than the pork loin. The sensory evaluations indicated that the greatest overall acceptability in a low fat sausage was attained when the hydrated oatmeal or tofu were at their 15% addition level, respectively.

"Tocols are natural antioxidants that occur in grains that may benefit human and animal health. Therefore, it is important to accurately measure their concentrations in foods and feeds and to determine how genetics and growing environment can influence their levels. The first objective was to evaluate saponification versus direct extraction for the analysis of tocols in oat (Avena sativa L.). The second was to determine the effects of growing environment, hulled versus hulless phenotype, and genetic background on tocol concentration, and to see whether tocol and lipid concentrations were associated. For the first objective, oat grain samples from two locations were either extracted by saponification or directly with methanol, and extracts were analyzed by HPLC. The saponification method increased yield by approximate to 25% and was less time-consuming, so it was adopted for the second objective. For the second objective, oat genotypes were developed by crossing high-oil parents from Iowa State University with hulled and hulless cultivars adapted to arid Western environments. These were grown at Aberdeen and Tetonia, ID, and the tocols and lipid concentrations were analyzed at Madison, WI. There were significant effects of growing environment, genotype, and the presence or absence of hulls on tocol concentrations. Tocol and lipid concentrations were not correlated.

The latter acid exceeded proportionally the former one in genotypes with a low content of phenolic acids, namely in the amount of up to 50 mg/100 g of grain, especially in chaffless oats. Ferulic acid content varied in the range from 16.50 mg/100 g (cultivar Jakub) to 149.36 mg/100 g of grain (cultivar Izak). The content of coumaric acid ranged between 8.05 mg/100 g (cultivar Detvan) and 210.27 mg/100 g of grain (cultivar Izak). The fact that the samples were grown in the same year (2003) in one locality (Vigfas-Pstrusa, Slovak Republic) minimises the influence of soil and climatic conditions and proves that remarkable differences between the content of ferulic and coumaric acids and the total content of phenolic compounds were caused by the genetic outfit of oats. A high correlation was found between the contents of the total phenolic compounds, ferulic acid, coumaric acid and their sum. The corresponding correlation coefficients R had the values of 0.9229, 0.9141, and 0.9211, respectively. This correlation enables one to employ a simple and inexpensive method for the determination of the total phenolic compounds using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent for a rapid assessment of differences detectable in the content of the sum of ferulic and coumaric acids in oat samples in view of the selection of genotypes suitable for the preparation of functional foods.",903,99,99,0,99,99,0,0,1,4,279
"The commercial processing of oats is different from that of other cereals, such as wheat and maize. In northwest Europe, oats also appear to be more susceptible to contamination with HT-2 and T-2 toxins than other cereals. Mycotoxins, such as deoxynivanol and zearalenone, in cereals are already controlled by EU legislation. With regard to additional, impending legislation, this study examined HT-2 and T-2 toxins together with zearalenone, deoxynivalenol and other related toxins in a commercial oat mill and how the concentrations varied from raw oats to the final prepared oat flakes. Concentrations of each Fusarium mycotoxin fell by 90 - 95% during the process, with the major loss being a physical distribution occurring at the de-hulling stage. Initial studies of losses occurring at other stages, such as kilning or de-branning of prepared oat groats, suggest these to be small. The use of colour sorting after kilning showed higher concentrations of each mycotoxin in the discoloured groats. The feasibility of developing a predictive tool for the oat industry is examined.",904,0,99,-1,99,99,0,1,1,3,169
"Supplementation of milk and oat hydrolysate containing medium with Jerusalem artichoke concentrate (JAC) and subsequent fermentation with probiotic dairy starters resulted in substantial stimulation of probiotics Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus as well as yogurt starter culture Lactobacillus bulgaricus development and acidification rate. The strain-specific responses of the general yogurt cultures, as well as probiotics to the addition of JAC, should be considered to achieve optimal composition of probiotic strains and conformable fermentation conditions. JAC is suggested to be perspective prebiotic additive for fermented synbiotic milks or oat-hydrolysate-based products.",905,99,1,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,89
"The effects of cooking, baking, fermentation and drying on the extractability of P-glucan were studied. The P-glucan was isolated from porridge, bread and fermentate both fresh and dry. Analyses were performed using three hydrolysis methods: acid hydrolysis (AH) with H2SO4, lichenase hydrolysis (LH) and the modified AOAC 995.15 method (MH). As shown by the DP3:DP4 ratio, processing did not affect the structure of soluble P-glucan. Cooking increased the amount of soluble beta-glucan but baking decreased it. Thus, cooking appears to be the most favourable process when health effects are concerned. The results of the three methods were compared statistically. The AH and MH methods, which are based on measurement of glucose, gave similar results. LH, which is based on analysis of oligosaccharides, gave higher results than AH and MH. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Soluble fibre beta-glucan is one of the key dietary materials in the healthy food products known for reducing serum cholesterol levels. The micro-structural heterogeneity and micro-rheology of high-viscosity oat beta-glucan solutions were investigated by monitoring the thermally driven displacements of well-dispersed microspheres via video fluorescence microscopy. By comparing the distribution of the time-dependent mean-square displacement (MSD) and ensemble-averaged MSD of polystyrene microspheres imbedded in four concentrations of beta-glucan solutions, we found that the solutions exhibited perfectly homogeneous behaviour at <= 1%, but showed a certain degree of heterogeneity at 2%. Micro-rheology investigation revealed that beta-glucan solutions displayed nearly perfect viscous behaviour at <= 1%, but the property changed into viscoelastic at 2%. Both micro-structural heterogeneity and micro-rheological property shifts occurred over a small concentration range, between 1% and 2%, of beta-glucan.

"Oat bran protein concentrate (OBPC) was prepared from oat bran, and hydrolyzed using trypsin. Protein hydrolysates of three different degrees of hydrolysis (4.1%, 6.4% and 8.3% respectively) were obtained. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that oat globulin was the major protein component in OBPC. After trypsin treatment, acidic polypeptides were partly degraded into large peptides (M-r = 29,000-33,000) and small peptides (M-r < 20,000); however, basic polypeptides were almost intact. The functional properties of the resulting products were compared with those of control OBPC. Marked changes in the protein functionality were caused by proteolysis. The solubility, water-holding capacity, emulsifying activity and foaming ability of the hydrolysates gradually increased with the increase in DH. However, the oil-holding capacity, emulsifying stability and foaming stability of the hydrolysates reduced to a certain extent. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"Baking technology for tasty bread with high wholemeal oat content and good texture was developed. Bread was baked with a straight baking process using whole grain oat (51/100g flour) and white wheat (49/100g four). The effects of gluten and water content, dough mixing time, proofing temperature and time, and baking conditions on bread quality were investigated using response surface methodology with a central composite design. Response variables measured Were Specific volume, instrumental crumb hardness, and sensory texture, mouthfeel, and flavour. The concentration and molecular weight distribution of beta-glucan were analysed both from the flours and the bread. Light microscopy was used to locate beta-glucan in the broad. Proofing conditions, gluten, and water content had a major effect on specific volume and hardness of the oat bread. The sensory crumb properties were mainly affected by ingredients, whereas processing conditions exhibited their main effects on crust properties and richness of the crumb flavour. beta-glucan content of oat bread was 1.3/100g bread. The proportion of the highest molecular weight fraction of beta-glucan was decreased as compared with the original beta-glucan content of oat/wheat flour. A great part of beta-glucan in bread was located in the large bran pieces. (c) 2006 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Background: Soluble fibers lower serum lipids, but are difficult to incorporate into products acceptable to consumers. We investigated the physiological effects of a concentrated oat beta-glucan on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints in human subjects. We also compared the fermentability of concentrated oat beta-glucan with inulin and guar gum in a model intestinal fermentation system. Methods: Seventy-five hypercholesterolemic men and women were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: 6 grams/day concentrated oat beta-glucan or 6 grams/day dextrose (control). Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, week 3, and week 6 and analyzed for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, homocysteine and C-reactive protein (CRP). To estimate colonic fermentability, 0.5 g concentrated oat beta-glucan was incubated in a batch model intestinal fermentation system, using human fecal inoculum to provide representative microflora. Fecal donors were not involved with the beta-glucan feeding trial. Inulin and guar gum were also incubated in separate serum bottles for comparison. Results: Oat beta-glucan produced significant reduction from baseline in total cholesterol (-0.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/L) and LDL cholesterol (-0.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/L), and the reduction in LDL cholesterol were significantly greater than in the control group (p = 0.03). Concentrated oat beta-glucan was a fermentable fiber and produced total SCFA and acetate concentrations similar to inulin and guar gum. Concentrated oat beta-glucan produced the highest concentrations of butyrate at 4, 8, and 12 hours. Conclusion: Six grams concentrated oat beta-glucan per day for six weeks significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol in subjects with elevated cholesterol, and the LDL cholesterol reduction was greater than the change in the control group. Based on a model intestinal fermentation, this oat beta-glucan was fermentable, producing higher amounts of butyrate than other fibers. Thus, a practical dose of beta-glu",911,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,291
"The effect of oat bran extracts on the formation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) was studied in F344 mate rats. Extracts were prepared using various combinations of temperature (40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 degrees C: X-1), ethanol concentration (0, 5, 10, 15, or 20%: X,), and pH (5, 6, 7, 8, or 9: X-3). Among the various extracts tested, one ethanol extract (EE; 45 degrees C, 15% ethanol at pH 6) and one water extract (WE; 50 degrees C at pH 5) were selected based on their in vitro antitumor activity. The animals were fed with basal diet alone or basal diet supplemented with 0.25 or 0.5% of EE or WE for 6 weeks. During the initial 2 weeks of the 6-week test period, the rats were subcutaneously injected with DMH (30 mg/kg) 4 times for the induction of ACE DMH induced an average of 322.7 and 142.9 aberrant crypts (AC) and ACF, respectively. A low dose (0.25%) of EE (containing 38.3% beta-glucan) and WE (containing 22.8% beta-glucan) greatly reduced the numbers of DMH-induced AC and ACE Significantly, ACF consisting of more than 3 AC were reduced by half in which the effect of EE, containing a higher concentration of beta-glucan, was superior to that of WE.

"In our previous work we used ground oat (Avena sativa) seeds as an inexpensive source of enzymes for the modification of FA or their chemical derivatives. We have extended this work by observing the products derived from an intact fat and three vegetable oils through the concerted action of oat seed enzymes. A modified reversed-phase HPLC protocol was devised that allowed the quantification of FFA, epoxy FA, and acylglycerols without derivatization. It was found that the addition of the surfactant deoxycholate or calcium chloride was needed to observe best hydrolysis of TAG to FA. Without an added oxidant, lipase action produced up to 80% by weight of FA at pH 7-9 with small amounts of DAG and MAG. When the oxidant t-butyl hydroperoxide was added in the presence of deoxycholate, the FA were partially converted to epoxide derivatives (up to 35% by weight). When calcium chloride replaced deoxycholate, only 4% by weight of the product was epoxide derivatives. The highest levels of FA epoxides were generated at pH 7, and up to 15% by weight of the product at this pH was epoxymonostearin (monoepoxyoctadecanoylglycerol). The optimal molar amount of t-butyl hydroperoxide to add with deoxycholate for high epoxide formation was 1.4 to 2.8 times the amount of fatty esters in soybean oil. In no instance were oxidized DAG or TAG detected, demonstrating that a highly specific enzymatic process was responsible for epoxide formation. The epoxide products may be used to produce polyols with high viscosity for grease preparations.",916,99,1,1,99,-1,2,1,0,2,248
"Background: Methodologic choices affect measures of the glycemic index (GI). The effects on GI values of blood sampling site, reference food type, and the number of repeat tests have been insufficiently determined. Objective: The objective was to study the effect of methodologic choices on GI values. Comparisons were made between venous and capillary blood sampling and between glucose and white bread as the reference food. The number of tests needed for the reference food was assessed. Rye bread, oatmeal porridge, and instant mashed potato were used as the test foods. Design: Twelve healthy volunteers were served each test food once and both reference foods 3 times at 1-wk intervals in a random order after they had fasted overnight. Capillary and venous blood samples were drawn at intervals for 3 h after each study meal. Results: GIs and their CVs based on capillary samples were lower than those based on venous samples. Two tests of glucose solution as the reference provided stable capillary GIs for the test foods. The capillary GIs did not differ significantly when white bread was used as the reference 1, 2, or 3 times, but the variation was lower when tests were performed 2 and 3 times. Capillary GIs with white bread as the reference were 1.3 times as high as those with glucose as the reference. The capillary GIs of rye bread, oatmeal porridge, and mashed potato were 77, 74, and 80, respectively, with glucose as the reference. Conclusions: Capillary blood sampling should be used in the measurement of GI, and reference tests with glucose or white bread should be performed at least twice.",917,99,0,0,0,1,1,0,3,1,268
"The impact of extrusion on physical and sensory properties and on the in vitro bile acid (BA) binding was examined for N979 and Jim oat (Avena sativa) lines with 8.1 and 4.8% beta-glucan, respectively. Based on hardness and edibility of products made from Jim oats, moisture concentrations of 16-25% and temperatures of 165-180 degrees C were selected for N979 extrusion. Jim-based cereal had a significantly greater (P < 0.05) expansion ratio than did N979-based cereal at most moistures. N979 cereal was browner, but not harder, than Jim cereal. Extruded products from N979 and Jim oats had 5.29-5.99% and 3.38-3.94% beta-glucan, respectively. Changing extrusion temperature or moisture content did not affect beta-glucan concentration in the products. N979 cereal made at 165 degrees C and 16% moisture had greater BA binding than at other conditions, and had crunchiness comparable to cereals made at other conditions. BA binding of Cheerios brand breakfast cereal was close to that of N979 cereal made at 180 degrees C and 18% moisture, but lower than cereals made at other conditions. Cereals made from Jim and N979 oats were browner, harder, coarser, and crunchier than Cheerios breakfast cereal.

"Immunological methods based on monoclonal antibodies with varying specifities towards gluten proteins have been used to control the purity of gluten-free products. Commercially available methods have been developed to detect gluten proteins found in wheat. However, difficulties have occurred in quantifying barley proteins with the same accuracy as wheat proteins. Barley is also a common contaminant in oat products. In this study, oat flour samples were deliberately contaminated with known amounts of barley flour and analysed using two commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The methods were based on an omega-gliadin antibody and an R5 antibody. The results obtained with the R5 antibody were overestimates while the omega-gliadin antibody underestimated the higher barley prolamin content. This study showed that inaccuracies in ELISA assays in quantifying barley contaminations can possibly be eliminated by using a hordein standard. However, it is necessary to know the source of contamination. This would prevent overestimation of the hordein content of gluten-free products. Overestimation unnecessarily reduces the variety of gluten-free products and may decrease compliance to a gluten-free diet. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",919,1,-1,1,99,-1,2,2,0,1,180
"In the present work, a whole-grain oat substrate was fermented with lactic acid bacteria to obtain a drink, combining the health benefits of a probiotic culture with the oat prebiotic beta-glucan. The levels of several factors, such as starter culture concentration, oat flour and sucrose content, affecting the fermentation process, were established for completing a controlled fermentation for 8 h. The viable cell counts reached at the end of the process were about 7.5 x 10(10) cfu ml(-1). It was found that the addition of sweeteners aspartame, sodium cyclamate, saccharine and Huxol (12% cyclamate and 1.2% saccharine) had no effect on the dynamics of the fermentation process and on the viability of the starter culture during product storage. Beta-glucan content in the drink (0.31-0.36%) remained unchanged both throughout fermentation and storage of the drink.

"Some physical and chemical properties of four oat (Avena sativa L.) varieties (BDMY-6, BDMY-7, Che-Chois and Y-2330) harvested from Konya in Turkey were investigated. The weight of the grain, moisture, crude protein, crude ash, crude fibre, crude energy, crude oil and water-soluble extract contents of all oat variety grains were analysed. Contents of aluminium, calcium, cadmium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, lead, potassium and manganese were also determined in the oat grains. The specific gravity, refractive index, free fatty acids, peroxide value, saponification number and unsaponifiable matter were determined in the grain oil. Tocopherol contents of these four oat grain oils were measured. Palmitic acid (15.72%), oleic acid (33.97-51.26%) and linoleic acid (22.80-35.90%) were found to be rich in protein, oil, fibre, unsaturated fatty acids and minerals, suggesting that they may be valuable for food uses.

"Whole flours from four oat lines with different amounts of beta-glucan (4.8-8.1%) wee examined for their antioxidant activity and total phenolic and lignin concentrations. These data, along with the beta-glucan percentages, were compared with bile acid (BA) binding. Only the lignin concentrations of the flours significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with the BA binding values. The oat flours also were fractionated into bran, protein concentrate, starch, layer above starch, and soluble beta-glucan (SBG)-free flour, and their BA binding capacities were evaluated. The bran fractions were the only fractions that bound greater BA than did the whole oat flours on dry matter basis. Extraction of the soluble beta-glucan to create the SBG-free flour significantly (P < 0.01) decreased the BA binding of the remaining flour. These data suggest that BA binding of the oat flours involves the synergistic interactions of the oat components, with beta-glucan and lignin (insoluble fiber) having a great impact.",923,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,152
"The formation of SCFA in rats fed fermented oat fibre concentrates was compared with that of rats fed native oat fibre concentrate. The cultures used were lactic acid bacteria consisting of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (V2), the exopolysaccharide-producing strain Pediococcus damnosus 2.6 (Pd) and L. reuteri (Lr). The materials were incorporated into test diets yielding a concentration of indigestible carbohydrates of 80 g/kg (dry weight). Rats fed the V2-fermented fibre-concentrate diet yielded higher caecal and distal concentrations of acetic acid (P < 0 center dot 01) than rats fed the native fibre concentrate. All the fermented fibre concentrates resulted in a higher propionic acid concentration in the distal colon (P < 0 center dot 05), while rats fed Pd-fermented fibre concentrate resulted in lower concentration of butyric acid (P < 0 center dot 05, P < 0 center dot 01) in all parts of the hindgut as compared with rats fed the native fibre concentrates. Butyrate concentrations ranged between 5-11 mu mol/g (distal colon) and 6-8 mu mol/g (13 d faeces). Higher proportions of acetic acid (P < 0 center dot 05; P < 0 center dot 01) were observed in the caecum of rats fed the fermented fibre concentrates. Rats fed Pd- and Lr-fermented fibre concentrates produced higher proportions of propionic acid (P < 0 center dot 05; P < 0 center dot 01) in the caecum. Changes in SCFA formation in the caecum, distal colon and faeces of rats fed the fermented samples compared with the native sample indicate that these microbes probably survive in the hindgut and that modification of the microflora composition with fermented foods is possible.

"Lactic acid-fermented foods have been shown to increase Fe absorption in human subjects, possibly by lowering pH, activation of phytases, and formation of soluble complexes of Fe and organic acids. We tested the effect of an oat gruel fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v on non-haem Fe absorption from a low-Fe bioavailability meal compared with a pasteurised, fermented oat gruel and non-fermented oat gruels. In a cross-over trial twenty-four healthy women with a mean age of 25 (sd 4) years were served (A) fermented gruel, (B) pasteurised fermented gruel, (C) pH-adjusted non-fermented gruel, and (D) non-fermented gruel with added organic acids. The meals were extrinsically labelled with Fe-55 or Fe-59 and consumed on 4 consecutive days, for example, in the order ABBA or BAAB followed by CDDC or DCCD in a second period. Fe absorption was determined from isotope activities in blood samples. The fermented gruel with live L. plantarum 299v increased Fe absorption significantly (P < 0 center dot 0001) compared with the pasteurised and non-fermented gruels. The lactic acid concentration in the fermented gruel was 19 % higher than in the pasteurised gruel, but the Fe absorption was increased by 50 %. In the gruel with organic acids, the lactic acid concentration was 52 % lower than in the pasteurised gruel, with no difference in Fe absorption.

"The study was aimed at verification of the following hypothesis: differences in antioxidant capacity of diets consisting of different cereals and byproducts affect the antioxidant status of the consumers of these diets. To validate that hypothesis this study investigated the contents of polyphenols and alpha-tocopherol as well as the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in vitro of cereals and their fractions ( barley, husked and naked oat, oat bran, and triticale); the nutritional and antioxidant properties of diets containing these cereals, applied in a 4-week feeding experiment on rats, were also assessed. Among the cereals examined, the highest TAC was reported for barley (13.16 mu mol of Trolox/g) and the lowest for naked oat (3.84 mu mol of Trolox/g). Compared with cereals, the TAC of buckwheat waste was 2-3 times higher (25.2 mu mol of Trolox/g). The antioxidant capacity of diets, calculated in vitro, ranged from 6.35 mu mol of Trolox/g for naked oat type diet to 10.51 mu mol of Trolox/g for barley type diet. Results of an in vitro study were confirmed in changes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and the level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the serum of rats fed diets with the highest and lowest antioxidant capacities in vitro; the barley diet increased the activity of GPx (37.63 units/mL) and decreased the level of TBARS (4.82 mu g/g), whereas the naked oat diet had an opposite effect (31.16 units/mL and 5.91 mu g/g, respectively).",928,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,2,2,0,239
"The structural, physicochemical, and biological properties of sulfated oat beta-glucan were characterized. The degree of substitution of the sulfated oat-beta glucan was obtained by elemental analysis, which was 0.68.

The molecular weight of the sulfated beta-glucan was determined to be 68 kDa and its viscosity decreased by almost 2 orders of magnitude while its solubility increased by more than 100% compared to that of the native beta-glucan. In addition, the sulfation caused the reduction of in vitro bile acid binding capacity of oat beta-glucan due to the new anionic character and decreased molecular weight.

"Different levels of shortening in cookies (10%, 20% and 30% by weight) were replaced with 20% jet-cooked oat bran, also called Nutrim oat bran (OB), to prepare cookies with fewer calories. The cookies containing Nutrim OB were investigated in terms of rheological and physical properties and compared with a control. As more shortening was replaced with Nutrim 013, a decrease in the diameter and an increase in the height of cookies were observed. The increased moisture content from Nutrim OB caused a decrease in the dynamic viscoelastic properties of cookie dough. Squeezing flow method showed shear thinning behaviours in all cookie doughs. Also, the elongational viscosity of cookie dough decreased significantly with more replacement of shortening with Nutrim OB. The rheological properties of cookie dough during baking indicated that all of the samples had similar types of viscoelastic characteristics during baking. However, the cookies containing more Nutrim OB exhibited more elastic properties which resulted in a decreased cookie diameter. There was no significant difference in cookie hardness among samples with up to 20% shortening replacement but the cookies became lighter in colour as the Nutrim OB content was increased.",930,99,99,0,99,0,0,0,2,3,189

"A microbially safe process for the enrichment of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in oats was developed. The process consists of hydrolysis of oat lipids by non-inactivated oat flour, followed by propioni-bacterium-catalyzed isomerization of the resulting free linoleic acid to CLA. The first stage was performed at water activity (a(w)) 0.7, where hydrolysis of triacylglycerols progressed efficiently without growth of the indigenous microflora of flour. Thereafter, the flour was incubated as a 5% (w/v) aqueous, sterilized slurry with Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii. The amount of CLA produced in 20 h was 11.5 mg/g dry matter corresponding to 116 mg/g lipids or 0.57 mg/mL slurry. The oat flour had also the capability to hydrolyze exogenous oils at a(w) 0.7. Sunflower oil, added to increase linoleic acid content in triacylglycerols 2.7-fold, was hydrolyzed rapidly. Isomerization of this oil-supplemented flour as a 5% slurry gave final CLA content of 22.3 mg/g dry matter after 50 h of fermentation, corresponding to 118 mg/g lipids or 1.14 mg/mL slurry. Storage stability of CLA in fermented oat slurries at 4 degrees C was good.",933,1,99,1,1,99,3,0,0,2,177
"Three concentrations of oat flour (OF), 0, 2 and 4% (w/w), were added to beef patties which had either 5, 10 or 20% fat levels. Raw and cooked patties were analysed for protein, fat, moisture, ash and pH. Patties were further evaluated for cooking characteristics, colour parameters (L*, a*, b*) and sensory properties. Moisture content decreased in raw patties as a result of the addition of OF but OF increased the moisture content of cooked patties. OF addition did not change the protein, fat and ash contents of either raw or cooked patties. Increasing fat concentration decreased cooking yield. OF improved the cooking characteristics of patties. Reducing the fat significantly decreased the lightness values of patties. Patties with OF had slightly higher b* values than control treatments. Increasing fat level increased juiciness, flavour and texture scores and 4% OF increased the juiciness scores, OF had no effect on other sensory properties.",934,0,1,99,99,0,1,0,2,2,151
"The study was conducted to evaluate effects of silage type (grass-red clover vs. pure grass) and grain supplement (oats vs. barley) on rumen fermentation, post-ruminal nutrient flows, diet digestion and milk production. Four primiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows fitted with cannulae in the rumen and duodenum were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square experiment with four 28-d experimental periods and 2 x 2 factorial arrangements of treatments. Using red clover-containing (40%) silage rather than pure grass silage had minor effects on rumen fermentation or diet digestion but increased non-ammonia nitrogen (N) flow in terms of increased flows of microbial and dietary N entering to the small intestine. This was reflected as a reduced ruminal N degradability on grass-red clover diets. Furthermore, grass-red clover diets in comparison to grass silage diets increased milk lactose concentration and yields of milk, protein and lactose. Feeding oats in replacement for barley had minor effects on rumen fermentation or post-ruminal non-ammonia N flows but reduced digestibility of organic matter and neutral detergent fibre in the diet. Using oats rather than barley increased yields of milk and lactose but reduced milk protein concentration. Oats also increased proportions of C-18:0 and C-18:1 in milk fat and reduced those of C-10:0 to C-16:0. It is concluded that inclusion of red clover and replacement of barley with oats in grass silage based diets have beneficial effects in dairy cow production.",935,1,-1,1,99,1,3,1,0,1,232
"Market value of oat grain is largely determined by test weight or bulk density, yet little is known of the physical basis for test weight in oats. We have hypothesized that a larger sized groat relative to the oat grain (the kernel with the hull) would generate higher test weight oats because the groat is the densest structure in the oat grain, We tested this by measuring oat grain size and oat groat size by digital image analysis for 10 genotypes grown in 10 environments. We also measured other physical characteristics of the oats grains and groats including mean grain and groat mass, test weight. and groat percentage. We found that the groat/ grain size ratio was highly correlated with test weight. Because the oat grain image area was nearly twice that of the groat, we suggest that there are significant amounts of empty space within the oat hull, which detracts from test weight, We also found that oat groat size distributions like oat grains, fit bimodal distributions better than normal distributions.",936,99,0,0,99,1,1,0,2,2,172
"Yoghurts were produced from cow's milk containing 1, 2 and 3 kg milk fat/100 kg or 1, 2 and 3kg of oat-maltodextrin/100 kg (maltodextrin included 5 kg beta-glucan/100 kg). Non-fat yoghurt, without the addition of maltodextrin, was used as a control product. The yoghurts were estimated for sensory properties and using instrumental texture profile analysis (TPA) and rheological investigations, which had to set flow curves and their description by the Ostwald de Waele and Casson models; counting apparent viscosity were also done. Replacing milk fat with maltodextrin in yoghurts does not show significant differences in the sensory analysis, rheological properties and most of the texture parameters. The addition of milk fat in the amount of I kg/100 kg or maltodextrin in 2 kg/100 kg caused all increase in apparent viscosity of yoghurts. The addition of oat-maltodextrin caused a decrease in consistency index value and a deviation from the Newtonian flow and yield stress, similar to the effects caused by adding milk fat. No relationship between the results of the sensory evaluation, the instrumental texture parameters and rheological properties, especially in yoghurts containing milk fat, were shown.",937,99,0,99,0,0,0,0,3,2,186
"Two new oat beta-glucan hydrocollolds (designated C-trim20 and C-trim30) obtained through a thermalshearing process were evaluated for their potential use in food products as functional ingredients. Their rheological characteristics were investigated using steady and dynamic shear measurements. Both samples exhibited typical shear-thinning and viscoelastic properties of random coil polysaccharides. The Cross equation was also used to examine the dependence of their apparent viscosity on shear rates. Furthermore, the effects of flour replacement with C-trim20 on the physical, rheological, and sensory properties of cookies were studied. The cookies containing C-trim20 exhibited reduced spreading characteristics compared with the control due to their increased elastic properties. Also, higher water content and water activity were observed in the C-trim20 cookies. However, flour replacement with C-trim20 up to 10% produced cookies with instrumental texture properties similar those of the control, which was in good agreement with the sensory results.",938,0,99,0,99,99,0,0,2,3,144
"To identify the compounds evoking the characteristic cereal-like, sweet aroma of oat flakes, an aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) was applied to a distillate prepared by solvent extraction/vacuum distillation from commercial oat flakes. Among the nine aroma-active compounds detected by gas chromatography-olfactometry and AEDA in the flavor dilution (FD) factor range of 4-1024, eight odorants, for example, (E)-beta-damascenone, (2)-3-hexenal, and butanoic acid, showed only low FD factors. However, one odorant eliciting the typical cereal, sweet aroma of the flakes was detected with the highest FD factor of 1024. By mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements followed by a synthesis, (E,E,Z)-2,4,6-nonatrienal, exhibiting an intense oat flake-like odor at the extremely low odor threshold of 0.0002 ng/L in air, was identified as the key odorant of the flakes. By means of a newly developed stable isotope dilution analysis using synthesized, carbon-13-labeled nonatrienal as the internal standard, a concentration of 13 mu g of (E,E,2)-2,4,6-nonatrienal per kilogram of the flakes was measured. Model studies suggested linolenic acid as the precursor of nonatrienal in oats.",939,99,1,0,99,99,1,0,1,3,172
"Two experimental high beta-glucan oat (Avena sativa) lines (7.64 and 8.05%) and two traditional lines (4.77 and 5.26% beta-glucan) were used to evaluate the effect of beta-glucan quantity and molecular weight on bile acid (BA) binding. The oat flour samples were digested by an in vitro system that simulated human digestion. No significant differences among oat type were found in the overall P-glucan, starch, and pentosan digestibilities. Considering the standard, cholestyramine, as 100% bound, the relative BA binding for the oat flour samples on a dry matter basis was in the range of 7.5-14.8%, which is higher than the values determined for some other grains and plant materials in the literature. Although the high P-glucan flours bound a high amount of BA, no significant correlations were found between P-glucan content in the flours and BA binding. Significant correlations were found between BA binding and insoluble dietary fiber content. Partial hydrolysis with lichenase of the P-glucan molecules did not affect the BA binding. A summary of all data suggested that BA binding is a multicomponent-dependent process.",940,99,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,175

"Objectives: To investigate side by side the effects on serum lipoproteins and postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations of beverages enriched with 5 or 10 g of beta-glucans from oats or barley. Design and setting: An 8-week single blind, controlled study with five parallel groups carried out at two centres under identical conditions. Subjects: A total of 100 free-living hypercholesterolaemic subjects were recruited locally and 89 completed the study. Interventions: During a 3-week run-in period all subjects consumed a control beverage. For the following 5-week period four groups received a beverage with 5 or 10 g beta-glucans from oats or barley and one group continued with the control beverage. Blood samples in weeks 0, 2, 3, 7 and 8 were analysed for serum lipids, lipoproteins, glucose and insulin. Postprandial concentrations of glucose and insulin were compared between control and the beverage with 5 g of beta-glucans from oats or barley. Results: Compared to control, 5 g of beta-glucans from oats significantly lowered total-cholesterol by 7.4% ( P<0.01), and postprandial concentrations of glucose ( 30 min, P = 0.005) and insulin ( 30 min, P = 0.025). The beverage with 10 g of beta-glucans from oats did not affect serum lipids significantly in comparison with control. No statistically significant effects compared to control of the beverages with barley beta-glucans were found.

"were not influenced by deformation in the amplitude sweep. Complex viscosities decreased with frequency (in all samples) and were independent of deformation (in extruded meal and bran). In shear experiments, beta-glucan solutions were structurally viscous non-Newtonian solutions with rheostable behaviour. beta-Glucan (2%) from bran had the highest and that from autoclaved meal had the lowest apparent and process viscosities. Fluid dynamic parameters may influence the flow, diffusion or transport behaviour of beta-glucan during digestion processes in the small intestine, but the influence of the viscous behaviour is limited.

"The sensory quality of extruded oat, stored in light and darkness in packages with different oxygen transmission rates (including the use of an oxygen absorber), was evaluated after 3 months of storage at 38 degrees C and 10 months of storage at 23 degrees C. To reduce the costly and time consuming shelf life and packaging evaluation, the possibility of reducing the number of sensory attributes to be analyzed and to accelerate shelf life testing was studied. The intensity of oat odor, paint odor and crispiness were found to describe the main differences among the samples. By increasing the temperature from 23 to 38 degrees C for samples stored in darkness, packaging evaluation tests for extruded oat might be performed in approximately one third of the time. Changes in headspace oxygen concentration in the packages due to oxygen consumption were in agreement with the sensory changes in the oat. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"The fine structures and rheological behaviours of aqueous flour dispersions and of beta-glucan, (1 -> 3,1 -> 4)-beta-D-glucan isolates obtained from 18 registered varieties of normal covered barley seeds and four registered oat varieties, grown in the same location in Greece, were investigated. The beta-glucan content of the barleys and oats varied between 2.5-5.4 and 2.1-3.9%, respectively (dry matter basis). Heat treatment of the barley and oat flour dispersions with 80% (v/v) ethanol, to inactivate endogenous beta-glucanases, had a stabilizing effect on the viscosity profile of the flour slurries. The relationship between total beta-glucan content and aqueous slurry viscosity (at 247 s(-1)) of the heat-treated barley flours was weak (r(2)=0.45, p < 0.05, n=18). beta-Glucans were isolated by water extraction at temperatures slightly below the gelatinization temperature of starch, enzymatic removal of starch and partial removal of contaminating proteins by adjustment to pH 4.0-4.5, and subsequent precipitation of the water-soluble beta-glucans with 80% (v/v) ethanol. The cellulosic oligomers released by the action of a (1 -> 3,1 -> 4)-beta-D-glucan hydrolase showed cellotriosyl and cellotetraosyl units, accounted for 91.1-92.1% for barley and between 92.4 and 94.1% for the oat preparations; the respective molar ratios of tri- to tetra-saccharides (DP3/DP4) ranged between 2.73-3.05 (barley) and 2.16-2.42 (oat). Steady shear measurements confirmed the random coil type behaviour of freshly prepared beta-glucan solutions (5 and 7%, w/v). The rate at which shear thinning began was dependent on both concentration and molecular size of the polysaccharide. Most of the beta-glucan dispersions followed the Cox-Merz rule, except Mucio, a variety with high M-w beta-glucan (2.39 X 10(5)). Viscoelastic characterization, at 8% (w/v), of three barley beta-glucan aqueous dispersions differing in molecular size, indicated that the low molecular weight sample exhibited shorter gelation time and higher gelation rate (I-E = [dlog",945,-1,1,0,99,99,1,1,1,2,294

"Fermentation of a prebiotic containing oat substrate with probiotic lactic acid bacteria and yeast strains is an intriguing approach for the development of new synbiotic functional products. This approach was applied in the present work by using pure and mixed microbial cultures to ferment a heat-treated oat mash. Results show that the strains studied were appropriate for oat fermentation and the process could be completed for 6-10 h depending on the strain. The viable cell counts achieved within this time were above the required levels of 10(6)-10(7) cfu ml(-1) for probiotic products. Both single lactic acid bacteria strains and mixed cultures of the same strains with yeast were found suitable for oat fermentation. However, the pure LAB cultures attributed better flavour and shelf life of the oat drinks. The content of the prebiotic oat component beta-glucan remained within 0.30-0.36% during fermentation and storage of the drinks obtained with each of the strains used. Thus, these products would contribute diet with the valuable functional properties of beta-glucan. Also, the viability of pure and mixed cultures in the oat products was good: levels of cell counts remained above the required numbers for probiotic products throughout the estimated shelf-life period.

"A novel chemiluminescence method for the determination of antu has been developed based on the reaction between potassium permanganate in acid medium with this rat-poison in the presence of formaldehyde as an emission enhancer. The main feature of the system used is that the recording of the whole chemiluminescence intensity-vs-time profiles can be obtained, using the stopped-flow technique in a continuous-flow system. This enables the use of three quantitative parameters adjustable via software settings, one of them a typically kinetic parameter, such as rate of the light-decay reaction, and the others conventional parameters, such as maximum emission intensity and total emission area, which are proportional to the analyte concentration. The optimum chemical conditions for the chemiluminescence emission were investigated. The effect of common emission enhancers, such as formic acid, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, acetaldehyde, quinine, fluorescein, rhodamine B, and rhodamine 6G, was studied. The parameters selected were sulfuric acid 4.0 mol L-1, permanganate 0.1 mmol L-1, and formaldehyde 1.0 mol L-1. The calibration graphs obtained with each one of the measurement parameters were linear for the concentration range from 0.05 to 3.00 mu g mL(-1). The detection limits ranged from 0.005 to 0.010 mu g mL(-1), and RSD values (n = 10) of 0.99-1.79% at a 0.30 mu g mL(-1) concentration level and 1.71-2.22% at a 1.0 mu g mL(-1) concentration level were obtained. The present chemiluminescence procedures were applied to the determination of antu in different kinds of samples, such as river water, wheat, barley, and oat grain samples.

"Background and aim: Cereal products with low postprandial glycemic response are encouraged in the management of hyperglycemia. In this study, we determined the postprandial glycemic response of two different oat bran products in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we investigated the effects of oat bran flour on postprandial glucose response following an oral glucose load. Methods and results: A randomized, controlled, repeated measures design with two test series was used. Twelve type 2 diabetic patients participated in five 2-h meat glucose tolerance tests on separate occasions. Volunteers were given in random order oat bran flour, oat bran crisp and glucose toad providing 12.5 g glycemic carbohydrate (series 1), 25 g glucose load alone and 25 g glucose load with 30 g oat bran flour (series 2). Finger-prick capillary blood analysis was carried out fasting and then 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the start of the meal. The oat bran flour had a lower 0-120 min area under the glucose response curve (AUC) (47 +/- 45 mmol min/L) than the glucose load (118 +/- 40 mmol min/L) (p < 0.002), but there was no difference between the oat bran crisp (93 +/- 41 mmol min/L) and the glucose load in this respect. The oat bran flour decreased the glucose excursion from baseline by 1.6 mmol/l (2.4, 0.8) (mean (95% CI)) and 1.5 mmol/l (2.0, 1.1) at 30 and 45 min after the glucose load, respectively. Conclusions: Oat bran flour high in P-glucan had a tow glycemic response and acted as an active ingredient decreasing postprandial glycemic response of an oral glucose load in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

"beta-Glucan extracted from oats was subjected to reductive amination, producing a cationic beta-glucan derivative of which physiological properties were characterized. The degree of substitution was obtained from elemental analysis, which was 0.48. In addition, the distribution of amino groups in the beta-glucan derivative was investigated by FT-IR analysis. In vitro bile acid binding capacity of the aminated beta-glucan was examined, showing significantly higher bile acid binding activity than native beta-glucan. Moreover, the beta-glucan derivative showed pronounced antimicrobial effects against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibition activities which were dependent on its concentration. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) experiments demonstrated that the beta-glucan derivative stimulated the synthesis of nitric oxide.

"Prior work has shown that oat (Avena sativa) seeds are a rich source of peroxygenase, an enzyme that promotes the oxidation of carbon-carbon double bonds to form epoxides. Ground and defatted oat seeds were used as a low-cost source of peroxygenase. A systematic study of the epoxidation of i-butyl amides from linseed oil was conducted. Hexane was used as the primary component of the reaction media to eliminate the need for extraction. We found that the addition of a small amount of buffered water containing Tween 20 enhanced the epoxidation activity when using t-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide as oxidants. This activity could be further enhanced by the addition of isopropyl ether. Conditions for larger-scale reactions were developed and applied to amides prepared from linseed, soybean, and canola oils. Because of enzymatic selectivity, the epoxidation of adjacent double bonds was low, and monoepoxides from the amides of oleate and linoleate predominated; the diepoxide, N-i-butyl-9,10-15,16-diepoxy-12(Z)-octadecenamide, was obtained from the amide of linolenate. The enzymatically epoxidized amides from the oils were hydrolyzed in dilute acid, and the distribution of the various classes of polyols was determined. Reflecting the high proportion of starting monoepoxides, saturated diols and diols with one double bond were the major polyols obtained from soybean and canola oils. Because linseed oil contains a high proportion of linolenate, polyols obtained from the epoxides of this oil had a major amount of the tetrol, N-i-butyl-9,10,15,16-tetrahydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenamide. In contrast, the components of polyols obtained from the hydrolysis of commercial epoxide preparations of soybean and linseed methyl esters followed by amide formation were primarily saturated diols and furan derivatives resulting from the presence of adjacent epoxide groups in these preparations.",951,-1,1,99,1,1,3,1,0,1,276
"Peanuts, pork scratchings, oatmeal and two types of muesli were stored in two experiments, where external factors (light, oxygen concentrations, product-headspace ratios) were varied, and where packaging materials with different properties (light transmission and oxygen permeability) were used. The oxidative changes in the products were followed by the formation of hexanal as detected by headspace gas chromatography (headspace-GC), free, radicals as detected by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and sensory evaluations. Generally, increased oxygen availability and exposure to light resulted in increased lipid oxidation. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that light accounted for the greatest systematic variation of the relative levels of free radicals in peanuts, oatmeal and muesli, whereas the oxygen availability had the largest influence on the formation of hexanal. The opposite was observed for pork scratchings, where oxygen had the most significant effect on the formation of radicals. It is concluded that ESR and headspace-GC complement each other in detecting the oxidative changes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",952,1,99,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,164
"Objective: To determine the effect of particle size (flour vs. flakes) on glycemic responses after oats and barley (Prowashonupana cultivar), which contain high amounts of soluble fiber, are consumed by overweight women. Design: Ten women, average age 50 years and body mass index 30, consumed glucose (1 g/kg body weight) and four test meals (1 g carbohydrate/kg body weight; 2/3 of the carbohydrate from oat flour, oatmeal, barley flour, or barley flakes and 1/3 from pudding) in a Latin square design after consuming controlled diets for 2 days. Blood samples were collected at fasting and periodically after each meal. Results: Peak glucose and insulin levels after barley were significantly lower than those after glucose or oats. Glucose areas under the curve (AUCs) after test meals compared with AUCs after glucose were reduced after both oats and barley (29-36% by oats and 59-65% by barley) (p < 0.002). Insulin AUCs after test meals compared with glucose AUCs were significantly reduced only by barley (44-56%) (p < 0.005). Indexes for insulin resistance (HOMA, MFFM, Cederholm) after the oat and barley meals were not different from indexes after the glucose meal. Glucagon and leptin responses did not significantly differ for the carbohydrates tested. Conclusions: Particle size of the oats or barley had little effect on the glycemic responses. Both oat and barley meals reduced glycemic responses; the high soluble fiber content of this barley appeared to be a factor in the greater reduction observed.",953,1,-1,0,1,0,2,1,2,0,241

"This investigation determined the effects of fermented oat-based products containing both native and microbial beta-glucans on plasma lipids and on fecal total bacterial count and Bifidobacterium ssp. The study was randomized, double blind with 3 parallel groups. Sixty-two free-living volunteers with moderately increased plasma cholesterol levels were recruited. In the final analysis, 56 subjects remained, as 6 subjects had left the study either due to lack of time (n = 2), unwillingness to continue the regimen (n = 2), or for other reasons (n = 2). During the first 3 weeks, all subjects received a fermented dairy-based product (control product, run-in period). On the following 5 weeks, I group continued with the control product, whereas the other 2 groups were given fermented oat-based products (intervention period, 3-3.5 g native beta-glucans per day). One of the oat products (ropy) was cofermented with an exopolysaccharide-producing strain, Pediococcus damnosus 2.6. A significant (P = .022) reduction in total cholesterol by 6% was observed in volunteers who had eaten the fermented, ropy, oat-based product compared with the control group. No other significant changes in plasma lipids were found. A significant increase in total bacterial count (P = .001) and Bifidobacterium ssp (P = .012) was observed in fecal samples from volunteers in the group who had eaten the fermented, ropy, oat-based product.

"Five Canadian oat genotypes were grown at six environments in Manitoba to assess the effects of genotype, environment, and genotype-by-environment interaction on oat starch properties and end-product quality. Genotypic variation was significant for total starch, amylose content, starch swelling volume (SSV), Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) pasting viscosities, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermal properties, and starch gel texture as well as the quality of flakes and cooked oatmeal made by laboratory-scale methodologies. Environment was the dominant factor contributing to the total variation of starch content, RVA pasting viscosities, SSV, and DSC thermal properties. Most measurements of starch gel and oatmeal texture were not affected by growing environment. Crossover analysis revealed that changes in the ranking of genotypes across environments occurred for starch RVA hot paste, breakdown and shear thinning viscosities, work of gel compression, flake hydration capacity, and the proportion of large flakes, indicating that breeding for these traits would require multiple testing sites. Trends were observed between oatmeal texture and several flake and starch gel properties, warranting further study. Results of this study indicated that there is a potential to breed Canadian oat cultivars with improved functional end-product quality for use in the milling and food manufacturing industries.",957,1,99,1,99,99,2,0,0,3,198
"The purpose of this study was to use an oat hydrocolloidal fibre composition, called Nutrim-5, for extending the use of rice flour in making Asian noodles. Nutrim-5 is one of a family of beta-glucan-containing hydrocolloids that is prepared by thermo-shear processing of oat flour or bran. The rheological properties of the noodle flour composites indicated that Nutrim-5 contributed binding qualities to the composites. Nutrim-5 appeared to contribute functionality to the rice flour, allowing for larger quantities to be used in the making of Asian noodles. The noodles were prepared in 20 kg batches by mixing blends of wheat flour, rice flour, and Nutrim-5 with alkali, salt solution, and egg. After mixing and kneading into smooth sheets, the noodles were cut, curled, and deep fat-fried. By using 10% by weight Nutrim-5 in the formulation, it was possible to satisfactorily make noodles using 50% rice flour. The cooking loss and tensile strength were measured and found to be satisfactory for this amount of rice flour in the noodles. A trained sensory panel also indicated that these noodles did not reveal any difference in taste. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",958,99,0,99,1,99,1,0,1,3,186
"A series of extrudates was prepared from oat meal, oat bran and Novelose 330((R)), differing in concentrations of individual dietary fibre (DF) components, such as beta-glucan and resistant starch, as well as total DF. After simulated digestion, the digested DF-rich oat-based extrudates were used to evaluate their physiological effects in vitro. A strong interaction occurred between the digested extrudates and bile acids (BA). The binding of BA increased with increasing proportions of oat bran, total DF, insoluble DF and beta-glucan in the extrudates. Dihydroxy-BA was more strongly bound to the extrudates than trihydroxy-BA. Interactions at pH 5.0 were greater than at pH 6.5. During fermentation of digested extrudates with human faecal samples, concentrations of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) formed and the molar proportion of butyrate increased continuously. Higher SCFA concentrations were found when extrudates contained more oat bran, soluble and insoluble DF and beta-glucan. Extrudates, on the basis of oat, have several beneficial nutritional and protective effects in vitro. Therefore, physiological effects occurring in the small and large intestine are also related to the DF composition of the cereal products. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"beta-(1-->3),(1-->4)-D-GIucan (beta-glucan) was extracted from 93 Swedish and 41 American oat samples using hot water containing CaCl2 and thermostable (x-amylase. The samples showed a large variation in both the content of extractable beta-glucan (0.76-3.68%) and the average molecular weight ((1.25-1.78) x 10(6) g mol(-1)). An analysis of the variance of beta-glucan content and the molecular weight of Swedish oat samples grown in 2000 and 2001 was done with cultivar and harvest year as factors. It showed that the extractable P-glucan content was a heritable trait whereas molecular weight depended more on environmental factors. The American oat samples had a higher average content of extractable beta-glucan (2.24%) and a somewhat higher average molecular weight (1.58 x 10(6) g mol(-1)) than the Swedish oat samples (1.43% and 1.49 X 10(6) g Mol(-1)).",960,1,99,1,99,1,3,0,0,2,130
"The ability of different lactic acid bacteria to influence the physicochemical characteristics (content, viscosity and molecular weight) of dietary fibre in beta-glucan-rich barley and oat concentrates was investigated. The cultures used were Lactobacillus acidophilus and the exopolysaccharide producing strain Pediococcus damnosus 2.6, together with the yoghurt culture, V2 (a mixture (1:1) of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptocoecus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). Two methodologies, one including filtration and another centrifugation-dialysis, to quantify the dietary fibre, were compared. The centrifugation-dialysis method generally gave significantly (P < 0.05) higher values than the filtration method (for example, 79.8 g/100 g DW versus 59.6 g/100 g DW for the total fibre in the native barley fibre concentrate) with the exception of soluble barley fibres. The insoluble fibre content was found to decrease after fermentation (58.8 g/100 g DW to 39.0/37.0 g/100 g DW in barley and 26.0 g/100 g DW to 4.5/3.0 g/100 g DW in oats as analysed by the centrifugation-dialysis method). The soluble fibre in the barley fibre concentrate was apparently not affected by fermentation, while contents and maximum viscosities of the soluble fibre in oat fibre concentrates decreased after fermentation. However, the molecular weight was apparently not affected. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",961,99,0,99,-1,0,0,1,2,2,203
"Twenty lactating Holstein cows ( 5 primiparous and 15 multiparous) were used in a 5 x 5 Latin Square design, with 5 treatments and 3 periods of 21 d each. Diets contained 25% corn silage, 25% oat silage, and 50% concentrate ( dry matter basis). The 5 treatments tested in the experiment were long oat silage (LOS), medium oat silage (MOS), fine from long oat silage (FLOS), fine from medium oat silage (FMOS), and half LOS plus half FLOS (LFLOS). The geometric mean particle length (GMPL) of the diets was 6.68, 5.19, 4.46, 4.35, and 5.39 mm for LOS, MOS, FLOS, FMOS, and LFLOS, respectively. The LFLOS was designed to provide dietary GMPL similar to MOS, but with a more bimodal particle size distribution (PSD). Linear and quadratic effects of GMPL were tested, based on the mean GMPL of the feed actually consumed (cGMPL). Contrasts were used to test for the effect of different PSD ( MOS vs. LFLOS) and to test for differences between FMOS and FLOS, which would indicate unequal fermentations in the MOS and LOS silos. No differences were detected between FMOS and FLOS in most of the variables measured. Increasing cGMPL linearly decreased dry matter intake, milk production, and milk protein percentage and yield without affecting milk fat percentage, milk fat yield, ruminal pH, and ruminal volatile fatty acid concentration. Although cows fed diets with increasing cGMPL spent more time eating and chewing per day and per kilogram of dry matter intake, there was no effect of cGMPL on rumen pH. Feeding medium oat silage increased milk fat percentage and yield compared with feeding a mixture of long and fine oat silage.",962,99,0,0,99,-1,0,1,2,2,276
"Low-fat Italian sausage was prepared with hydrated oat flakes at 10, 20 and 30% (w/w), and precook times of 0, 2 and 4 min. Cook loss and expressible moisture, cutting force and texture profile analysis, color and consumer sensory analysis were analyzed by response-surface methodology. Minimum cook loss occurred at 16.3% of the hydrated oat and 0.76 min precook time, while expressible moisture decreased with increasing oat levels and decreasing precook time. In general, both cutting force and hardness decreased with hydrated oat level. Measurements of L*, a* and b* showed a slightly lighter product and a shift to more red and yellow cooked product at intermediate oat levels and precook times. For sensory attributes, both oat level and precook time were significant. Greatest flavor and texture likeability were attained with hydrated oat levels of 3-12 %, and precook times of 1.5-3 min. Greatest overall likeability occurred over a region of 0-14% hydrated oat, and 1.1-3.3 min precook time.",963,99,99,1,99,1,2,0,0,3,159
"A sensor array (electronic nose) was successfully applied for predicting the content of hexanal and other volatiles in different dry fat-containing products, showing the potential of replacing time-consuming traditional laboratory analysis by faster in-process monitoring methods. Unfortunately, prediction of free radical content was not successful, making early prediction of oxidation by sensor array infeasible. Owing to the non-specificity of the sensors, a generic model could not be generated even though a series of standards was shown to have a high correlation between hexanal concentration and individual or multiple sensor responses. PCA models of sensor array responses of eg pork scratchings revealed a clear separation of samples stored in the experimental factor light versus darkness.

"Background/Aims: A healthy diet is a key factor in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death for women in industrialized countries. In this regard, soluble fibers may have beneficial effects on the plasma lipoprotein/lipid profile. The objective of the present study was to investigate the plasma lipoprotein/lipid response to dietary fibers in overweight premenopausal women within a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Following a 2-week run-in phase, 34 premenopausal women (age: 22-53 years) were randomly assigned either to the control group (no supplement) or to the treatment group, which received 2 oat bran-enriched muffins per day (28 g/day of oat bran) during 4 weeks. Results: Supplementation with oat bran had a beneficial effect on plasma HDL-C levels. Indeed, compared to the control group (n=16), a mean increase in plasma HDL-C levels of 11.2% was observed in women eating the oat bran supplement (n=18) (p=0.01), whereas the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio decreased by 7.0% (p=0.002). Results were similar after adjustment for age, apo E genotype and weight change. Conclusion: These results suggest that oat bran-rich foods have beneficial effect on the metabolic profile of overweight women. Integration of these foods as part of a healthy diet may, therefore, improve the cardiovascular risk profile of women. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.",965,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,212
"Yoghurts from cow's milk containing 2 kg milk fat/100 kg or 2 kg of an oat-maltodextrin/100 kg (maltodextrin included 5 kg beta-glucan/100 kg), were weighed on a laboratory scale and stored in refrigerator conditions for 21 days. Non-fat yoghurt without the addition of maltodextrin was used as a control product. The yoghurts were analysed after 1, 7, 14, and 21 days of storage. Sensory evaluation, instrumental texture profile analysis, and rheological investigations were carried out. They included the determination of the flow curves and the description by Ostwald de Waele and Casson models as well as an account of the apparent viscosity. Differences in the sensory quality of yoghurts containing milk fat or maltodextrin were not found, whereas these yoghurts were characterized by better sensory quality than the control product. The storage time had a significant influence on the sensory evaluation and the texture parameters. During the storage time, the apparent viscosity of yoghurts decreased. A decrease in consistency index value, in deviation from Newtonian flow, and yield stress was noticed, whereas in Casson's viscosity of the yoghurts, an increase was found.",966,99,99,99,0,0,0,0,2,3,182
"The formation of exopolysaccharides (EPS) by Pediococcus damnosus strain 2.6 was investigated in two different high P-glucan suspensions of oat (OBC) and barley (BBC). Bacterial growth was confirmed by measuring pH, colony forming units (cfu), viscosity and ropiness during growth. Growth and an increase in viscosity of the beta-glucan suspension based on oat were observed whereas only a minor growth and no significant effect on viscosity was seen in the beta-glucans suspension based on barley. Higher bacterial growth and higher final viscosity and ropiness were observed in samples that were mixed with the OBC and an ordinary commercial oat-base (Adavena(R) G40). These results show the potential of using a combination of a high beta-glucan suspension of cereals to generate fermented products containing both high levels of native beta-glucans from oats or barley and also microbial beta-glucans from the starter culture.

"In the oat (Avena sativa L.) kernel, many compounds play a role as an antioxidants. Among them, tocols (which are classified as tocopherols and tocotrienols) are quite abundant in the bran fraction of the sperm, an interesting point for the nutritional e of oats, which are usually consumed as whole grain. In this paper eight Italian oat cultivars have been analysed in terms of tocols content, g a fast NP-HPLC procedure. The cultivars expressed mainly the alpha- and beta- homologues of both tocopherols and tocotrienols, and a large variability in the content of these molecules was observed. The analysis of samples of the same cultivars grown in three different locations (in North, Centre and South of Italy) revealed the strong influence of the environment on the accumulation of tocols in kernels. Among these antioxidant compounds, only the a-tocotrienol fraction resulted to be positively correlated with the lipidic content of the kernel.",968,99,1,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,151
"Experimental oat lines high in beta-glucan (6-7.8%) and traditional lines (3.9-5.7% beta-glucan) were used to evaluate the effect of beta-glucan on pasting (by rapid viscoanalysis) and thermal properties (by differential scanning calorimetry) of oat flours. Significant correlations established between beta-glucan concentration and the pasting parameters after amylolysis demonstrated the role of beta-glucans in oat pasting. The relative decrease of peak viscosity (PV) observed after enzymatic removal of beta-glucans was correlated with beta-glucan concentration (r = 0.880, P < 0.010) and reconfirmed their contribution to pasting. A significant increase of PV with beta-glucan concentration obtained under conditions of either autolysis (deionized water used for dispersion) (r = 0.89, P < 0.010) or inhibition (silver nitrate solution used for dispersion) (r = 0.91, P < 0.001) might be explained by an increase in water retention capacity caused by the beta-glucans. Predictive models of beta-glucan concentration based on the whole pasting profile or selected profile regions were developed using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Prediction of beta-glucan based on the whole profile obtained in the silver nitrate solution was the most effective (r = 0.93, correlation coefficient of predicted vs. analyzed beta-glucans, P < 0.050). No correlations were observed between the thermal properties of oat flours and the beta-glucan concentration.",969,99,0,1,99,99,1,0,1,3,207
"A detailed electron spin resonance (ESR) investigation of the spectroscopic features and kinetic behaviours over a range of temperatures of the long-life free radicals induced in a sample of ground oat that had been irradiated with gamma-radiation is reported. Unirradiated ground oat exhibited a weak, broad single-line ESR spectra centered at g = 2.0048 +/- 0.0008. The structure of this radical is unknown and is assigned as radical III in this work. The gamma-irradiation of oats yields radical III and other radical species. Although all these species are stable at 77 K, some of them are very unstable at room temperature. A model based on three radical species (designated I, II and III) was used to describe the room temperature spectra of their decay at room and at high temperatures. Annealing studies at six different temperatures were used to determine the kinetic behaviour and activation energies of the radicals induced by radiation. A dose-response curve was also constructed and it was concluded that ground oat is potentially a good dosimetric material. The presence of an ESR signal after a storage time of 90 days was interpreted as providing an opportunity to distinguish irradiated from unirradiated oats.",971,99,1,0,99,1,2,0,1,2,196
"Cereals are an important part of diets for hypercholesterolemic patients. However, some of these patients are allergic to these natural products. The purpose of the current study was to compare oatmeal with equal in nutritional values two allergy-free amaranth meals to determine whether this pseudocereal can be a substitute for allergic to cereals individuals. The total phenols of the samples were determined with the Folin-Chocalteu reagent, anthocyanins, and flavonoids spectrophotometrically. The antioxidant activities were estimated with nitric oxide scavenging radical (NO) and by beta-carotene bleaching (beta-carotene). It was found that the contents of different protein fractions, antioxidant compounds, and the antioxidant activities of oatmeal were significantly higher than those of the two amaranth samples. The results of kinetic reactions showed that samples differed in their capacities to quench these radicals, and oats have shown more antioxidant activity than amaranth. High correlation was observed between antioxidant activities and phenols (R-2 = 0.99). In the in vivo part of the investigation, 60 male Wistar rats were divided into five diet groups of 12 animals each; these groups were designated as Control, Chol, Chol/Oat, Chol/AmarI, and Chol/AmarII. The rats of the Control group were fed basal diet (131)) only.

Design: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial Intervention(s): Subjects (16 males greater than or equal to age 35; 14 postmenopausal females) were assigned, in random order, to oats (60 g oatmeal), vitamin E (400 IU) plus vitamin C (500 mg), the combination of oats and vitamins, or placebo, and underwent brachial artery reactivity scans (BARS) following a single dose of each treatment, and again following 6 weeks of daily ingestion, with 2-week washout periods. At each test, a provocation high-fat meal (50 g, predominantly saturated) was administered and subjects were scanned pre, and 3 hours post-ingestion. Results: Mean flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD; measured as percent diameter change before and after treatments) at baseline was 6.35 +/- 3.37. Oats increased FMD non-significantly (p > 0.05) with both single acute dose (from 6.07 +/- 6.25 to 9.22 +/- 8.82) and six weeks of sustained treatment (from 6.01 +/- 10.07 to 8.69 +/- 8.42). The direction of effect was negative for vitamins and the oat/vitamin combination with both acute and sustained treatment. There were no significant differences in FMD change among the treatments in either phase of the study, however when acute and sustained effects were pooled, oat treatment significantly augmented FMD (p < 0.05).

"Cake shortening contents were replaced with Nutrim oat bran (OB) and flaxseed powder, and the effects of these substitutions on the physical and rheological properties of cakes were investigated. Cakes with shortening replaced up to 40% by weight possessed a volume similar to that of the control cake produced with shortening. Replacement using Nutrim OB and flaxseed powder revealed significant color changes in both the cake crust and crumb. At high levels of substitution, the cake crust became lighter, while the crumb darkened. At >40% by weight substitution with either Nutrim OB or flaxseed, the cakes displayed increased hardness; however, cohesiveness and springiness increased gradually with increasing substitution. Increased substitution with Nutrim OB caused an increase in the measured shear viscosity and oscillatory storage and loss moduli of the cakes. Increased substitution with flaxseed caused decreases in these rheological parameters. Additional rheological experiments were performed to elucidate changes in the formulations during the baking process and indicated an increase in the elasticity of the baked batter with decreasing shortening.",975,99,1,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,169
"The applicability was evaluated of 16 different oats species and varieties of different provenance in the coeliac diet in view of the composition of the protein complex and immunological testing during two-year experiments (2001 and 2002).

"The possibility of using rapid spectroscopic methods to detect lipid oxidation of four standard food products-peanuts, pork scratchings, oatmeal and muesli-were investigated in a large screening experiment. Fluorescence, near-infrared [including visual (Vis/NIR)] and infrared (IR) spectra have been recorded during and beyond the normal shelf lives of the products and related by means of multivariate data analysis to reference oxidation measures of free radicals and hexanal, as well as to sensory evaluation. For pork scratchings, the three spectroscopic techniques were able to monitor the progressing level of oxidation: IR with good correlation to hexanal (r(2)=0.86), Vis/NIR with good correlations to free radicals (r(2)=0.82) and fluorescence with good correlations to both free radicals (r(2)=0.76) and hexanal (r(2)=0.83). In the case of IR, the best result was obtained using the region including the out-of-plane C-H of trans-fatty acids.

"Rheological properties of raw oat flour slurries were determined in experimental high beta-glucan (less than or equal to7.8%) and traditional oat lines (4-5% beta-glucan) grown in two consecutive years. Three different media were used to disperse oat flours: deionized water, silver nitrate solution (to inactivate endogenous enzymes), and alkali solution (to solubilize both water-soluble and water-insoluble beta-glucans). Significant correlations (P < 0.05) between viscosity of slurries and beta-glucan concentration obtained in either deionized water (r = 0.833), silver nitrate (r = 0.940), or alkali (r = 0.896) solutions showed that beta-glucans were the main contributor to oat extract viscosity. The highest correlation was obtained in silver nitrate solution, suggesting that inactivating endogenous enzymes is important to obtain high correlations. Predictive models of oat beta-glucan concentration based on the viscosity profile were developed using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Prediction of beta-glucan concentration based on viscosity was most effective in the silver nitrate solution (r = 0.949, correlation coefficient of predicted vs. analyzed beta-glucans) and least effective in the alkali solution (r = 0.870). These findings demonstrate that the beta-glucan in oat could be predicted by measuring the viscosity of raw flours in silver nitrate solution, and this method could be used as a screening tool for selective breeding.",979,1,99,1,0,99,2,0,1,2,208
"Mutagenised grains of the diploid oat, Avena strigosa Schreb., were screened for altered starch granules in the endosperm. Three mutant lines were identified: mutants lam-1 and lam-2 had granules that stained red with iodine solution and sga-1 had endosperm containing soluble material that stained red with iodine solution, as well as blue-staining starch granules. The lam-1 and lam-2 lines lack or have severely reduced amounts of granule-bound starch synthase activity, the granule-bound starch synthase I protein and the antylose component of starch in the endosperm. They therefore represent mutations of the waxy type. The red-staining, soluble material in the sga-1 mutant is very similar in appearance and chain-length profile to the phytoglycogen that accumulates in the endosperms of the sugary-1 mutants of cereals. All sugary-1 mutants lack or have reduced amounts of isoamylase activity. However, native gel assays reveal a normal isoamylase activity in the developing endosperms of sga-1 suggesting that it is not of the sugary-1 type. The nature of the mutation responsible for the sga-1 phenotype has yet to be discovered. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",980,1,-1,99,0,99,1,1,1,2,180

"Increased intestinal viscosity appears to be the major mode of action by which dietary oat P-glucan increases the fecal excretion of bile acids and thereby lowers blood cholesterol concentrations. The objective of this experiment was to investigate whether there is a difference in effects on blood lipids between two yeast-leavened oat bran breads containing beta-glucan (6 g/d) of low or high average molecular weight (HMW) (217 or 797 kDa, respectively). The breads were fed to 22 volunteers (women, n = 11; men, n = 11) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. The participants ate one bread for 3 wk as part of their normal diet and switched breads after a 2-wk washout period. Blood samples were drawn from fasting subjects and analyzed for lipids, insulin, glucose, and alpha- and gamma-tocopherol. The two experimental oat breads did not differ in their effects on any of the variables measured. Compared to baseline, however, consumption of HMW bread increased serum insulin by 22.6% (P < 0.03) and decreased blood glucose concentrations by 3.4% (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the molecular weight, when beta-glucan is consumed in oat bran breads as part of the habitual diet, does not play an important physiological role in moderately hypercholesterolemic humans.",983,-1,0,0,1,0,1,1,3,0,205
"The intake of phenolic acids and related polyphenolic compounds has been inversely associated with the risk of heart disease, but limited information is available about their bioavailability or mechanisms of action. Polyphenolics, principally avenanthramides, and simple phenolic acids in oat bran phenol-rich powder were dissolved in HCl:H2O: methanol (1:19:80) and characterized by HPLC with electrochemical detection. The bioavailability of these oat phenolics was examined in BioF1B hamsters. Hamsters were gavaged with saline containing 0.25 g oat bran phenol-rich powder (40 mumol phenolics), and blood was collected between 20 and 120 min. Peak plasma concentrations of avenanthramides A and B, p-coumaric, p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, ferulic, sinapic, and syringic acids appeared at 40 min. Although absorbed oat phenolics did not enhance ex vivo resistance of LDL to Cu2+-induced oxidation, in vitro addition of ascorbic acid synergistically extended the lag time of the 60-min sample from 137 to 216 min (P less than or equal to 0.05), unmasking the bioactivity of the oat phenolics from the oral dose. The antioxidant capability of oat phenolics to protect human LDL against oxidation induced by 10 mumol/L Cu2+ was also determined in vitro. Oat phenolics from 0.52 to 1.95 mumol/L increased the lag time to LDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner (P less than or equal to 0.0001). Combining the oat phenolics with 5 mumol/L ascorbic acid extended the lag time in a synergistic fashion (P less than or equal to 0.005). Thus, oat phenolics, including avenanthramides, are bioavailable in hamsters and interact synergistically with vitamin C to protect LDL during oxidation.",984,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,255
"The heat-induced aggregation of oat globulin was studied using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with on-line multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) and quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS). The unheated oat globulin exists as a mixture of hexamer (>95%), trimer, and dimer forms of hexamer. The molecular weight of the hexamer was estimated by MALLS to be 330 000, close to that deduced from the genomic cloned data of the acidic and basic polypeptides of oat globulin. From QELS measurements, it can be predicted that the hexamer exists as two annular trimeric rings, with a diameter of 11.8 nm, placed on top of each other, forming an oblate cylinder with a height of about 8.5 nm. Upon heating at 100degreesC, the oat globulin hexamers and trimers were dissociated into monomers. The heat-denatured monomers, probably assuming an extended structure, were associated to form small aggregates, which were further aggregated to high molecular weight complexes. Upon further heating (60 min), the soluble aggregates were associated to form insoluble aggregates. Aggregation of oat globulin occurred at a much faster rate at 110degreesC. The results indicate that the SEC-MALLS-QELS system is suitable for studying thermal aggregation of food proteins.",985,99,1,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,192
"Oats, different oat fractions as well as experimental and commercial oat-based foods, were extracted with hot water containing thermostable a-amylase. Average molecular weight and molecular weight distributions of beta-glucan in extracts were analyzed with a calibrated high-performance size-exclusion chromatography system with Calcofluor detection, specific for the beta-glucan. Oats. rolled oats, oat bran, and oat bran concentrates all had high Calcofluor average molecular weights (206 x 10(4) to 230 x 10(4) g/mol) and essentially monomodal distributions. Of the oat-containing experimental foods, extruded flakes. macaroni, and muffins all had high average molecular weights. Pasteurized apple juice. fresh pasta, and teacake, on the other hand, contained degraded beta-glucan. Calcofluor average molecular weights varied from 24 x 10(4) to 167 x 10(4) g/mol in different types of oat bran-based breads baked with almost the same ingredients. Large particle size of the bran and short fermentation time limited the beta-glucan degradation during baking. The polymodal distributions of beta-glucan in these breads indicated that this degradation was enzymatic in nature. Commercial oat foods also showed large variation in Calcofluor average molecular weight (from 19 x 10(4) g/mol for pancake batter to 201 x 10(4) g/mol for porridge). Boiling porridge or frying pancakes did not result in any beta-glucan degradation. These large differences in molecular weight distribution for beta-glucan in different oat products are very likely to be of nutritional importance.",986,99,1,99,1,1,3,0,0,2,224
"A method for microbial isomerization of oat linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was developed. The method includes hydrolysis of oat lipids in aqueous flour slurries by the endogenous oat lipase. Then, the flour slurry containing free linoleic acid is utilized as a substrate for the isomerization reaction carried out by resting cells of Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii. The isomerization reaction progressed most effectively when, after the lipid hydrolysis period, the pH of the slightly acidic oat slurry was elevated to 8.0-8.5 and maintained at this range. With slurries containing 5% (w/v) oat flour, the amounts of CLA formed per dry matter were up to 10.1 mg/g corresponding to 102 mg/g lipids or 0.44 mg/mL slurry. Increments in the flour content up to 15% increased the volumetric production of CLA to 0.85 mg/mL. The proportion of the cis-9,trans-11 isomer was 80% of the total CLA formed. CLA could be concentrated into the solid material of the oat slurry by acidification.",987,0,99,99,99,0,0,0,2,3,161
"In mature kernels of oat (Avena sativa L.) and other cereals, mixed-linked (1 --> 3; 1 --> 4)-beta-glucans and arabinoxylans are major structural polysaccharides in cell walls of the endosperm. However, (1 --> 3)-beta-glucans are deposited transiently in walls during cellularization of endosperm early in grain development [Planta 202 (1997) 414-426]. The absence of (1 --> 3)-beta-glucans in mature endosperm cell walls suggests that (1 --> 3)-beta-glucanases are active during endosperm development. To investigate the role of beta-glucanases during endosperm development, a (1 --> 3)-beta-glucanase cDNA, Oglc13, was isolated from an oat (A. sativa L.) kernel cDNA library. The enzymatic activity of the protein product, OGLC13, expressed from the cDNA in an in vitro expression system, exhibited substrate specificity for (1 --> 3)-beta-glucans. Oglc13 transcripts were detected in the endosperm of portions of developing kernels with the highest steady state level of mRNA at 15 days after anthesis (DAA) and not in vegetative tissues. Antibodies raised against OGLC13 immunoprecipitated (1 --> 3)-beta-glucanase activity from endosperm extracts of 10 and 15 DAA kernels and milky endosperm extracted from 15 DAA kernels. The OGLC13 antibodies did not precipitate (1 --> 3)-beta-glucanase activity from leaf extracts. These results indicated that Oglc13 is a unique (1 --> 3)-beta-glucanase expressed early in endosperm development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",988,0,0,99,99,99,0,0,2,3,216
"High hull content of oat (Avena sativa L.) limits its use as on-farm feed. Dehulling, used in the oat processing industry, can be performed on-farm, to increase nutritive value and energy content, A laboratory model of an impact oat dehuller, similar to a commercial device, was used to study the effects of rotation speed, grain characteristics and moisture content on hullability and groat energy content. Grain of oat cultivar Salo [from official variety trials, MTT Agrifood Research Finland, Jokioinen (60degrees49'N), 1996-2000] was assessed for quality prior to dehulling. Impact dehulling rotation speed ranged from 200 to 500 r min(-1) at 50 r min(-1) intervals, with moisture content of grains ranging from 10% up to 18%. Dehulling improved oat energy content markedly. Hullability was better at higher rotation speeds. 350 r min(-1) was determined to be adequate to result in improved quality as no marked additional improvements were demonstrated by increasing rotation speed further. As the proportion of hulless groats increased with higher rotation speeds, nutritional and energy content of groat yield improved consistently. The higher the grain moisture, the higher the proportion of grains retaining hulls. Impact debulling proved to be a potentially useful method to increase energy content of oat grains on-farm.",989,99,99,99,1,1,2,0,0,3,203
"Debulling improves markedly the feed value of oat (Avena sativa L.), but good storability of groat mass is required when large quantities of oat are dehulled at any one time. A laboratory model of an impact oat dehuller, similar to a commercial device, was used to study the effects of rotation speed and grain moisture content on groat breakage and the storage life of oat groats. Grain of oat cultivar Salo [from official variety trials, MTT Agrifood Research Finland, Jokioinen (60degrees49'N), 1996-2000] was dehulled with an impact oat dehuller using rotation speeds of 200 to 500 r min(-1) at 50 r min(-1) intervals. In an additional experiment, grains were moistened resulting in moisture content ranging from 10% to 18%. Proportion of broken groats and size distribution of groat particles were measured. Storability was determined through analysing the evolution of pentanal, hexanal and free fatty acid content after storing groats at 10, 20 and 30degreesC for two and five months. At higher rotation speeds more broken groats resulted, but dehulling did not cause any marked rancidification of the groats. Thus, impact dehulling is a practical method to increase the energy content of oat grains on-farm without such problems as groat breakage induced oxidation of fatty acids.",990,1,99,99,1,99,2,0,0,3,205
"Se-supplemented fertilization is the main factor affecting the selenium (Se) contents of cereals in Finland. Soil and climatic conditions determine the activity of selenate added to soils and bioavailability to plants. In the present study the Se contents and its variation in Finnish oats, the differences between oat cultivars and cultivation techniques were examined. The selenium (Se) contents of oats (Avena sativa L.) in Finland were examined during 1997-1999 in 3 types of trial: official variety, organic cultivation variety and organic vs. conventional cultivation trials. Farm samples were also examined. The mean Se contents of oats in official variety trials were 0.110, 0.120 and 0.160 mg kg(-1) dry weight (dw) range 0.016-0.460 mg kg(-1)dw in 1997-1999, respectively. The mean Se contents in farm samples were 0.050 and 0.130 mg kg(-1)dw in 1998 and 1999, ranging between < 0.010 and 0.330 mg kg(-1) dw. Considerable regional and seasonal variations existed. The Se contents of oats were significantly higher in 1999 probably due to the combined effect of not increased fertilizer level (from 6 to 10 mg Se kg(-1) fertilizer) and very low precipitation in 1999. The Se contents of oats were significantly lower in organic cultivation, due to the absence of Se-supplemented fertilization. Significant (P < 0.001) cultivar differences were detected in official variety trials. The cultivars Veli and Leila showed higher levels of Se.",991,99,99,1,1,99,2,0,0,3,224
"Natural toxins, such as mycotoxins, have emerged as a significant factor affecting the safety image of cereal grains as a raw material for the food and feed industry. The aim of the present study was to investigate the contents of trichothecenes in representative samples of oats during official variety, nitrogen fertilization and organic farming trials in Finland, 1997-1999. Further objectives were to promote industry and commerce by selection of high-quality oat varieties for various applications. The official variety trials conducted at 8-10 locations were managed following standard protocol. There were 2 types of agronomy trial, the first included comparison of oat cultivars grown in conventional and organic farming systems at 6 locations, and the second used 5 nitrogen rates (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg N ha(-1)) at 2 locations. Regardless of wet cold summer occurring in Finland during 1998, the concentrations of Fusarium toxins were lowest during this 3 year monitoring period. More mycotoxins were produced during the warm, dry summers of 1997 and 1999 than in 1998. In all, 55% of the oat samples in the official variety trials contained deoxynivalenol (DON) within the range of 50896 mug kg(-1). The differences in DON concentrations between organic and conventional cultivation were small. The results showed also that the use of various nitrogen fertilization levels only slightly affected the trichothecene concentrations. The contents of trichothecenes in Finnish grains appeared to be similar to or lower than those reported earlier in the Northern Hemisphere.",992,99,99,0,99,99,0,0,1,4,244
"beta-Glucan is a beneficial chemical compound in the diet of humans by decreasing the levels of serum cholesterol and blood glucose. The beta-glucan contents of oat groats were studied in official variety trials (1997-1999), nitrogen fertilization trials (1997-1999) and organic variety trials (1997-1998) in Finland. Eight cultivars were studied in the organic variety trials. Two of them, cultivars Puhti and Veli, were cultivated also with a conventional method at the same fields. The years 1997 and 1999 were very warm and dry and 1998 very cool and rainy. The effects of year and cultivar on beta-glucan content were significant in all three trial series. The Kolbu oat cultivar had a significantly lower beta-glucan content than other cultivars in all trials. N fertilization did not increase the beta-glucan contents of oats in Finland. The effect of cultivation method (traditional vr organic cultivation) had no significant effect on the beta-glucan content. The year x cultivar interaction significantly affected the beta-glucan contents of oat groats in N fertilization trials. The reaction of different cultivars to weather conditions was different.

"Oats contain 3-5% of mixed linked beta-glucan, or (1-3), (1-4) beta-D-glucan, referred to hereafter as beta-glucan. Oat beta-glucan is a viscous, and soluble dietary fibre component. Soluble and viscous dietary fibres, including the beta-glucan present in oats are associated with two major health promoting effects, i.e. the attenuation of postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels and the control of cholesterol. Increased viscosity in the intestine delays absorption of glucose and suppresses absorption of cholesterol and reabsorption of bile acids. In spite of its apparent key role physiologically the viscosity of beta-glucan has been discussed relatively little in terms of analytical procedures. In clinical studies performed with oats, the viscosity of beta-glucan has been properly documented in only a few cases. Viscosity of beta-glucan in foods and in the food digest depends on solubility, concentration and molecular weight. A food manufacturer aiming at health-promoting products must pay attention not only to sufficient concentration of beta-glucan (dose) in the raw material, but also to the processing methods that will ensure sufficient solubility of beta-glucan and minimize enzymatic or mechanical breakdown of the beta-glucan molecule. We have been working both with different food processes utilising oat fractions high in beta-glucan and with the development of a method for viscosity determination of the soluble beta-glucan fibre. This review discusses some of the aspects related to the development with a method that could predict the behaviour of beta-glucan in oat processing with respect to its anticipated physiological functions.",994,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,3,0,243
"In traditional oat processing practice the control of lipid reactions relies largely on empirical experiences and dogmatic principles rather than on profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms. However, in today's global food markets, the industry faces strict challenges in the development of new processes and applications where the prior experience is unsatisfactory or insufficient. The storage stability of novel oat products can be greatly enhanced by taking the mechanisms of lipid deterioration into account, and by adjusting the processing conditions accordingly so that these reactions can be minimized. The lipid reactions in oat products result in two different unwanted properties: bitter, astringent, taste or a rancid flavor. Chemically, these properties are associated to enzymatic hydrolysis of ester bonds and non-enzymatic oxidation of unsaturated fatty acyl chains respectively. The processing history oat product has a huge impact on which of these reactions predominates in oat products. The review focuses on the reactions of lipids in processed oat products, and identifies factors that are critical for enhanced shelf-life.",995,1,99,0,99,-1,1,1,1,2,166
"The biochemical and physiological reactions of germination have long been utilised to produce barley malt for brewing and other purposes. Also some oat malt has been produced as raw-material of ale and stout production. The main goals of malting have been the degradation of grain storage components to soften the kernel structure, synthesis of amylolytic enzymes and production of nutrients for brewing yeast. Also flavour and colour attributes have been important. During the recent years interest has arisen also in the secondary metabolites produced during germination, which can have valuable health promoting properties and act as bioactive or functional compounds in foods. By using a tailored germination/malting process a desired combination of valuable properties may be obtained in germinating grains or seeds. All this requires knowledge and know-how of the germination process and the biochemistry behind it.

"This study is a part of a larger project aiming to produce new, healthy, and tasty food ingredients from oat. Germination and different heating processes can be used to improve the texture and flavour of cereals. In this study effects of germination and wet and dry heating on the microstructure, instrumental structure and sensory properties of two oat varieties were assessed. The microstructure of native, germinated, autoclaved and extruded grains of the hulled cv. Veli and hull-less cv. Lisbeth was examined by light microscopy, the texture was measured by determining the milling energy and hardness of the grains and sensory characteristics were evaluated with descriptive sensory profile analysis. In cv. Veli the cells of the starchy endosperm were smaller than in cv. Lisbeth and P-glucan was concentrated in the subaleurone layer. In cv. Lisbeth P-glucan was evenly distributed in the starchy endosperm. The grains of cv. Lisbeth were more extensively modified in the germination process than the grains of cv. Veli, otherwise the effects of processing on the grains of the two cultivars were similar. Germination caused cell wall degradation, autoclaving and extrusion cooking caused starch gelatinization. Autoclaving resulted in the hardest perceived texture in oat. Gelatinization of starch appeared to contribute more to the hardness of oat groats than the cell wall structure. Of the instrumental methods used in this study the milling energy measurement appeared to be the most useful method for the analysis of the effects of processing on grain structure.",998,0,-1,99,1,99,1,1,1,2,244
"Effects of added gluten and transglutaminase on microstructure, instrumental texture and sensory characteristics of bread baked with 51% wholemeal oat flour were compared in order to determine how changes in the state of macromolecules - protein and starch - correlate with changes in sensory and instrumental structure. Light microscopy, instrumental texture profile analysis, and descriptive sensory analysis were used to analyse the test breads. Addition of gluten and transglutaminase affected the structure of the protein network and distribution of water between the protein and starch phases. The differences in microstructure were quantified by determining the areas of starch and protein in the micrographs by image analysis. Breads baked with added gluten and water were softer and less gummy than the oat and wheat reference breads in the texture profile analysis. Addition of transglutaminase made the breads harder and gummier than the breads baked without the added enzyme. In the descriptive sensory analysis breads baked with added gluten or added gluten and water were evaluated as more soft and springy than the reference oat bread. Sensory characteristics of bread texture correlated well with the texture and microstructure measured instrumentally.",999,1,1,99,99,99,2,0,0,3,188
"A study was carried out to improve anther culture ability of the non-responsive cultivated oat, Avena sativa L. cv. Puhti by introgressing favourable alleles from the responsive wild red oat, Avena sterilis L. acc. CAV 2648. Anther culture ability of these parental lines and F-2 progenies of their cross and two backcrosses was tested. Genotype effects were significant on all anther culture traits measured. The number of anther culture derived embryo-like structures was highest in acc. CAV 2648, and the number of green regenerants from the Puhti x CAV 2648 progeny. Anther culture response was greatly reduced in backcross progeny and was least in cv. Puhti. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was used to test for marker associations with oat anther culture traits in a population of 38 F-2 progenies. Two RAPD markers were putatively associated with improved production of green regenerants (one derived from acc. CAV 2648 and the other from cv. Puhti). One marker putatively associated with decreased albino plant regeneration (derived from acc. CAV 2648). These markers might be useful for selecting alleles for better anther culture ability among progeny of planned crosses. In addition, three markers, derived from acc.

"Development of an oat panicle proceeds from the uppermost terminal spikelet downward to the base of the particle. The intra-panicle variation in development is likely to influence potential grain size. This may result from differences in activity and duration of the cell division phase, vascular transport capacity, duration of filling period and/or hormonal balance. In this preliminary survey we studied intra-panicle variation in pollination (when clusters of pollen were visibly attached to stigmatic branches) of florets and cell division in developing grains immediately after pollination of the oat cultivars Belinda and Fiia. We found substantial intra-panicle variation for both traits. The highest cell number was found in the uppermost, most advanced, primary grain, while secondary grains tended to have fewer cells compared with their counterpart primary grains irrespective of their position. Results of an additional experiment indicated that death of the primary floret in the conventional oat cultivar Virma prior to pollination, resulted in higher weight of secondary grain, though this never equalled that of the primary counterpart. This limited growth capacity may partly result from lower cell number. These results encourage us to continue with experiments on the contribution of groat cell number to sink strength and grain-filling capacity.",1001,99,1,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,200
"The Finnish growing season is particularly short, with an intensive growth period, unfavourable rainfall distribution and frequently occurring fluctuations in climate that affect crop growth and yield formation. A three-year study was conducted in the field to determine the contribution of alterations in canopy structure, tillering and stem elongation among dwarf (D), semidwarf (SD) and tall (T) oat (Avena sativa L.) lines to yield formation. Yield components, leaf characteristics and straw traits were measured from six oat lines (D lines Pal and Grane, SD lines Hja 76416 and Salo, and T lines Veli and Jalostettu maatiainen) separately on the main shoot and tillers. Results indicated that long leaf area duration and high leaf area index were associated with increased grain yield probably due to more persistent and active assimilation. Also, higher number of leaves increased the grain yield. Higher peduncle, straw and node weights associating with increased grain yield may result from more abundant assimilate reserves; however, the longer the straw and peduncle, the lower the grain yield, which may result from increased lodging of SD and T lines. The traits contributing most to the grain yield varied greatly from year to year. It is concluded that no single dominant trait determined grain yield, since yield is a product of several different traits. SD lines seemed to be most promising for further breeding programs on the basis of their growth pattern and yielding ability.",1002,-1,0,99,99,99,0,1,1,3,234
"Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are exogenously applied chemicals that alter plant metabolism, cell division, cell enlargement, growth and development by regulating plant hormones or other biological signals. For example, some PGRs regulate stem elongation by inhibiting biosynthesis of gibberellins or through releasing ethylene. PGR effects are widely studied and reported on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), whereas there are only a few reports addressing oat (Avena sativa L.). This is likely to be a result of smaller acreage and lower intensity of oat management and production and hence a reduced need for stem shortening by PGRs. However, this is not the case for all cereal producing regions and there exists a need to understand the potential application of PGRs to oat production. This paper represents a review of the potential of PGRs to regulate stem elongation and other biological traits governing plant stand structure and yield components, with special emphasis on oat and its responses to PGRs. Yield improvement requires more heads per unit land area, more grains per head or heavier grains. Of these yield-determining parameters, the number of head bearing tillers and grain numbers per head, compared with grain weight, are more likely to be improved by PGR application. In the absence of lodging, PGR may reduce grain yield due to potential reduction in mean grain weight and/or grain number. Cultivation systems aiming at extensive yields with intensive use of inputs likely benefit from PGR applications more often compared with low or moderate input cultivation, for which cost effectiveness of PGRs is not frequently reached.",1003,99,0,-1,99,-1,0,2,1,2,261
"Harvested naked oat is not completely hulless. Hull content of various cultivars ranged between one and six percent. Genotype and environment control expression of nakedness. Using different threshing settings at different grain moisture contents, it was investigated whether grain moisture at threshing and combine harvester settings affected hull content and its relationship to germination capacity. Naked groats were stored at room temperature and analysed for protein content and fatty acid composition to determine storability. Grain moisture content at threshing had contrary effects on hull content and degree of hull retention in different years. Small grains tended to retain hulls more tightly during threshing. Grain filling capacity appears to be the dominant factor determining degree of nakedness rather than stage of maturity. The postulated protective nature of hulls was confirmed only for cultivar Lisbeth. Highly viable samples of grain of cv. Lisbeth, threshed at normal settings, contained a higher percentage of hulls than those with low germination capacity, while for cv. Bullion, a protective effect of the hulls was not evident. Grain moisture content at threshing did not affect protein content of naked cultivars, but some differences in fatty acid composition were recorded. Changes in lipid composition and volatile oxidation products during storage of groats were relatively moderate, indicating no major problems related to storage when naked oat was dried well.",1004,0,1,1,99,99,2,0,1,2,220
"Naked oat (Avena sativa ssp. nuda L.) is the highest quality small-grain cereal that can be grown at the northernmost margin of cereal production. It remains an under-utilised crop and it contributes less than 0.1% to the total oat area in Finland. In general, limited interest in growing naked oat more extensively is attributed to its weaknesses, which ironically result from nakedness that improves the quality of the crop. This paper reviews the available literature and assesses the balance of the arguments for and against naked oats. Results from the study were transformed into quantitative variables and analysed for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) using an analytical hierarchical process. As the importance of different SWOT-factors depends largely on targeted end-use of yield, separate analyses were done for use of naked oats as on-farm feed and as an input for the feed and food industry. If we aim at increasing area under naked oat in Finland, the most feasible starting point would be on-farm feed. In this case, strengths (high nutritional quality and energy content) outweighed weaknesses (sensitivity to grain damage) and threats (problems in germination). Increasing naked oat production in this respect is likely to encourage solving the remaining problems that deter industry. Threats (availability) regarding the feed industry and weaknesses (incomplete expression of nakedness) in the food industry out-weighed strengths (high nutritional quality and storability) and opportunities (potential niches).",1005,99,99,99,1,99,1,0,0,4,231
"It is generally recommended to eat a diet rich in dietary fiber Dietary fiber is usually divided into insoluble part and soluble part. Though the mechanism of action in the alimentary tract differs between these two types of fiber both are beneficial to human body. Cereal products are typically rich in dietary fiber especially in insoluble fiber Oats, however consists more soluble fiber than other cereal products, and the main component of oat soluble fibre is called beta-glucan. According to current knowledge, beta-glucan causes the main physiological effects, such as blood glucose control, in the human body. Glycemic/blood glucose control by diet is essential for optimal management of diabetes. Soluble fibre in particular has generated considerable interest in diabetes management as it has repeatedly been shown to decrease postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations both in person with diabetes and without. In addition to glycemic control, oats may assist in weight control due to high fiber content.

"In an attempt to introduce probiotic functionalities to breakfast cereals and similar food products, the technique of solid-state fermentation (SSF) was applied to cultivate Lactobacillus plantarum (NCIMB 8826) on oat bran and spent oats after lipid extraction by supercritical CO2 extraction. When compared to the frequently favored submerged processes for bacterium incubation, SSF presents not only the potential of simple downstream processing but also a more natural growth environment for the target bacterium. Preliminary studies confirmed that oat bran contained balanced nutrients to support a 25-fold bacterium propagation within a range of moisture content from 50% to 58% after a 36-h cultivation. Limited hydrolysis of the raw materials by the enzyme complex from submerged incubation of Aspergillus awamori and A. oryzae to increase nutrient accessibility extended the exponential growth phase and enhanced bacterial growth by over 183-fold. The process with the most potential, however, was to simultaneously grow both fungi aerobically on the raw materials in solid state to achieve sufficient hydrolysis, followed by controlled fungal autolysis at 65 degreesC prior to anaerobic bacterium incubation. Following this process bacterium population reached a maximum of 7.3 x 10(9) cells in each gram of the fermented solids, corresponding to a 1653-fold increase from the point of inoculation.",1007,99,1,99,99,1,2,0,0,3,205

The results indicated that as the fat content of cheese milk decreased, the fat, moisture in non-fat solids (MNFS) and yield values significantly decreased, and the moisture and total nitrogen values increased. The products fortified with the beta-glucan concentrate exhibited higher yield values and significantly lower pH (at 60 and 90 days of storage) than the control samples. In accordance with the latter values, the HPLC analysis showed that incorporation of the beta-glucan concentrate into the low-fat cheese milk led to a significant increase in the production of lactic, acetic and butyric acid throughout cheese ripening. Also, the extent of proteolysis in the treatments supplemented with the hydrocolloid significantly increased, especially at 60 and 90 days and was higher than the respective values of the control products. With regard to the rheological properties of the cheeses, incorporation of the beta-glucan concentrate brought about amelioration in all the textural parameters of the low-fat product, as determined by large deformation mechanical testing and sensorial analysis; significant correlations (p < 0.01) between instrumental and sensory data for hardness were identified. However, the addition of the beta-glucan preparation adversely affected cheese appearance and flavour in comparison with the control samples. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

"The aim was to study the effect of concentration and molecular weight of two oat and one barley beta-glucan preparation on the perceived sensory quality of a ready-to-eat soup prototype before and after freezing. Oat1 was a bran-type preparation containing high molecular weight beta-glucan; Oat2 and Barley were more processed and purified preparations with lower molecular weight. Nine soups containing 0.25-2.0 g beta-glucan/100 g soup and one reference soup thickened with starch were profiled by a sensory panel and their viscosity and molecular weight of beta-glucan was analysed. Freezing had no notable effects on the sensory quality of the soups. At the same concentration, soups made with the bran-type preparation were more viscous and had higher perceived thickness than soups made with processed, low molecular weight preparations. Barley soups had mainly higher flavour intensities than oat soups. Good correlations were obtained between sensory texture attributes and viscosity (r=0.70-0.84; Pless than or equal to0.001) and moderate correlations between flavour attributes and viscosity (r=-0.63--0.80; Pless than or equal to0.001). Technologically, beta-glucans are feasible thickening agent alternatives in soups. Preparations with lower molecular weight and viscosity are easier to add into a food product in higher quantities, but the role of high molecular weight beta-glucan in physiological functionality has to be kept in mind.

"Addition of antioxidants to foods prior to extrusion could result in more stable products. Benzoin, catechin, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid and quercetin were mixed with rolled oats and sucrose (10% by mass) to achieve a concentration of 1 g/kg. A control with no added antioxidants, and mixtures with 0.5 and 1.5 g/kg quercetin were also prepared. Mixtures were twin screw extruded in duplicate. Extrusion decreased total phenolics by 24-46%. Benzoin, chlorogenic acid and quercetin retarded hexanal formation at 12 weeks of storage at 35 C, but only quercetin was effective up to 24 weeks. Benzoin was most effective in controlling peroxide value and conjugated dienes at week 24. Conjugated diene formation was inversely related to quercetin concentration. A descriptive sensory panel found lower grassy, fruity and painty odors in some samples with added phenolics. While some of the antioxidants studied are not yet approved for use in foods, phenolic-rich spices and other foods may prove to be satisfactory antioxidants for extruded foods.

"Some countries now allow celiac patients to include oats in their gluten-free diet. Studies have shown that commercially available oats can be contaminated with gluten. The aim of the study was to analyse oat products and products naturally free from gluten to determine the degree of contamination. A total of 88 oat products and 22 products based on maize, rice, millet or buckwheat were analysed, using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a monoclonal antibody to gliadin. The ELISA is quantitative with a detection limit of 20 mg/kg gluten. Some of the positive samples were also analysed for the presence of DNA from wheat, barley or rye. Thirteen percent of the oat products had gluten content over 200 mg/kg. Of the products naturally free from gluten 14% had a gluten content over 200 mg/kg. There was a tendency for higher levels of contamination with increased processing. The risk of gluten contamination in oat products as well as in non-gluten cereals must be considered. The level of contamination was in most cases low. The results regarding oats can be compared to those of such cereals as maize, rice, buckwheat and millet.",1011,-1,0,99,99,1,1,1,1,2,192
"Aim: To study whether an oat bran enriched diet has a specific effect in lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols, in addition to caloric and fat restriction. Methods: We performed a randomized, controlled, parallel-group, single-centre study in which 1,994 patients from the Wehrawald Hospital (Todtmoos, Germany) were screened and 235 met the criteria male gender, hypercholesterolemia, and overweight. All patients in the Wehrawald Hospital took part in a 4-week standardized inpatient lifestyle health program consisting of dietary intervention, increased physical activity, and health education. Caloric restriction, fat modification, and oat bran supplementation were part of the nutritional regimen within the lifestyle health program. Ninety-nine patients were randomized to a fat-modified diet with caloric restriction and a daily intake of 35-50 g oat bran and 136 patients to a fat-modified, oat bran-free diet with caloric restriction. Fifty-three male overweight but normocholesterolemic subjects were selected as controls. Results: The most significant decreases in total cholesterol (-67.7 +/- 37.2 mg/dl; p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-56.3 +/- 35.1 mg/dl; p < 0.01), and apolipoprotein B (-42.4 +/- 34.1 mg/dl; p < 0.01) were found with the combination of the fat-modified and oat bran enriched food. Conclusions: Added to a fat-modified diet, oat bran within a practical range of intake significantly reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B. These beneficial effects occurred independent of covariables such as physical activity or caloric and fat restriction in the diet.",1012,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,236
"Films for potential food use were prepared from aqueous solutions of beta-glucan extracted from hulled barley, hull-less barley, and oats. The extracts (75.2-79.3% beta-glucan) also contained proteins, fat, and ash. Glycerol was used as a plasticizer. The films were translucent, smooth, and homogeneous in structure on both sides. Water vapor permeability of films prepared from 4% solutions of beta-glucan extracts were higher than those from 2% solutions, despite similar values for water vapor transmission rate. Mechanical properties were influenced by both beta-glucan source and concentration. The oat beta-glucan films showed higher tensile strength and water solubility, and lower color, opacity, and deformation values than those of barley. Films prepared from hull-less barley cv.

"Purified (1 --> 3)(1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucans (beta-glucans) from oat and barley with broad molecular weight (MW) distribution were separated into seven fractions using gradient precipitation with ammonium sulfate (NH4)(2)SO4. The MW of each fraction decreased consecutively with the concentration of (NH4)(2)SO4 at which it was precipitated. The MW distribution of each fraction was much narrower compared to the parent sample and is comparable to commercially available pullulan MW standards. To determine whether the fractionation process was separating sub-fractions of different structure, the original beta-glucan sample and each fraction were hydrolyzed by a (1 --> 3)(1 --> 4)-D-beta-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase (lichenase, E.C.3.2.1.73) and the liberated oligosaccharides were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography. The analysis revealed no differences in oligosaccharide pattern (DP 2-9) derived from each fraction and the parent sample. In particular, the tri/tetra. oligosaccharide ratio remained constant for all fractions, indicating no fractionation based on structural features had taken place. The effect of starting beta-glucan concentration on the fractionation process was studied. The results showed that it was possible to achieve good separation at overlapping parameter c[eta] lower than similar to3.5. Further increase in starting beta-glucan concentration hindered clear separation of the fractions. Temperature also affected the fractionation efficiency. The higher the temperature, the lower the amount of (NH4)(2)SO4 that was necessary to precipitate the samples of same MW. A Mark Houwink relationship was derived from the measured MW and intrinsic viscosity for fractions from oat and barley, respectively. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Samples of freshly ground corn kernels and freshly ground rolled oats were extracted via pressurized liquid extraction (accelerated solvent extraction) using four different organic solvents [hexane, methylene chloride (also known as dichloromethane), isopropanol, and ethanol] at two temperatures (40 and 100degreesC). Lipid yields varied from 2.9 to 5.9 wt% for ground corn and from 5.5 to 6.7 wt% for ground oats. With ground corn, more lipid was extracted as solvent polarity was increased, and for each individual solvent, more lipid was extracted at 100degreesC than at 40degreesC. With ground oats, the same temperature effect was observed, but the solvent polarity effect was more complex. For both corn and oats, methylene chloride extracted the highest levels of each of the nonpolar lipid classes. In general, for both corn and oats, increasing solvent polarity resulted in increasing yields of polar lipids, and for each solvent, more of each lipid class was extracted at 100degreesC, than at 40degreesC. Among the lipids in corn extracts, the phytosterols may be the most valuable, and total phytosterols ranged from about 0.6 wt% in the hot ethanol extracts to about 2.1 wt% in the hot hexane and methylene chloride extracts. Total phytosterols in all oat extracts were about 0.1 wt%. Digalactosyldiacylglycerol was the most abundant polar lipid in the oat extracts; its levels ranged from 1.6 wt% in the cold hexane extracts to 4.3 wt% in the hot ethanol extracts.",1016,0,99,1,-1,99,1,1,1,2,233
"Oat bran was used as a fat substitute in the production of meatballs. The effect of oat bran addition on the fatty acid composition, trans fatty acids, total fat, some physicochemical and sensory properties of the samples was studied. Meatballs were produced with four different formulations; the addition of 5, 10, 15 and 20% oat bran. Control samples were formulated with 25% fat addition as in commercial production. The major fatty acids were cis-oleic, palmitic and stearic acid in all the meatball samples, those with oat bran added as well as the control. Meatballs containing oat bran had lower concentrations of total fat and total trans fatty acids than the control samples. Meatballs made with 20% oat bran had the highest protein, salt and ash contents, L value (lightness), b value (yellowness), and the lowest moisture content and a value (redness). There was no significant difference among the meatball samples with respect to sensory properties, and all samples had high acceptability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"A set of 31 murine monoclonal antibodies was produced against (1-->3,1-->4)beta-D-glucan from oats (Avena sativa L.) chemically cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Monoclonal antibodies were tested for their cross-reactivity to related and unrelated polysaccharides. The antibodies reacted strongly to unmodified beta-glucan from oats and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and to lichenan from Icelandic moss, a polysaccharide with a structure similar to that of beta-glucan but which is not encountered in cereals. Cross-reaction to other polysaccharides tested was minimal at physiological levels. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that could routinely detect and quantify nanogram levels of soluble beta-glucan extracted from the flour of oats or barley was designed with one of these monoclonal antibodies. The beta-glucan extraction procedure from ground oat and barley samples and the ELISA were both optimized for reproducibility, accuracy, and throughput, and results were compared to values obtained from an established, commercially available enzyme-based assay. Correlations between the two assays were consistently high (r(2) > 0.9), indicating that the ELISA presented in this paper is a valuable alternative for assaying beta-glucan levels in cereals and cereal products, both routinely and in preparations in which beta-glucans are present in nanogram amounts. Development of the extraction procedure for ELISA is discussed.",1018,0,99,99,0,0,0,0,3,2,202
"The aim was to study the effect of concentration and molecular weight of four different beta-glucan preparations on the perceived sensory quality of a beverage prototype. The correlations between sensory and instrumental measures were investigated. Two of the preparations were bran-type containing high molecular weight beta-glucan, two were more-processed low molecular weight beta-glucan preparations. Twelve beverage samples containing 0.25-2% beta-glucan and one reference sample thickened with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were profiled by a sensory panel and analyzed by instrumental measurements (viscosity and molecular weight). Sensory profiles of the beverages varied at the same concentration of beta-glucan, depending on beta-glucan preparation. Beverages made with the bran-type preparations were more viscous and had higher perceived thickness than beverages made with more-processed, low molecular weight preparations. Moderate correlations were obtained between perceived thickness and sliminess and instrumental viscosity at all shear rates between 26 and 100/sec (r = 0.63-0.78; P less than or equal to 0.001). Technologically, more-processed beta-glucan preparations are easier to add into a beverage in amounts sufficient for achieving a physiologically functional amount of beta-glucan in a product.",1019,0,1,99,1,0,2,0,2,1,178
"Antioxidant products such as simple phenolic compounds and avenanthramides in oat (Avena sativa L.) may have health-promoting effects on humans. Therefore, it is very important to determine simple phenolics and avenanthramide concentrations of different genotypes of oats from different regions of the world. The aim of this research was to determine the concentrations of simple phenolics and avenanthramides of Turkish oat genotypes. According to the results, Turkish oat genotypes were significantly different for three major avenanthramides (Bc, Bp, and Bf) and the simple phenolic, ferulic acid (FA), while not significantly different for p-coumaric acid (PCA). Ferulic acid concentrations of Turkish oat genotypes were higher than a standard U.S. cultivar, Belle.

"Sprout damage of oats can occur when mature grain is left in the field after maturity and rainfall induces the germination process in the seeds. Although characteristics of sprout damage have been described thoroughly in many grains including wheat, rye, triticale, and barley, such characteristics have not been identified in oats. During a field study of oat quality, one site exhibited much higher rates of groat breakage during dehulling than other sites. Determination of falling number values on groat flour and a visual inspection of the grain suggested that the higher rates of groat breakage were associated with sprout damage. This hypothesis was confirmed with artificially sprouted oats, where sprouted grain exhibited lower falling numbers and lower stirring number values, suggesting increased alpha-amylase activity in the sprouted oats. Sprouted oats exhibited much more breakage during dehulling, decreased beta-glucan concentration, and decreased beta-glucan integrity, as evaluated from the viscosity of steamed groat flour slurries. We suggest that the increased breakage was a result of the weakening of cell walls, as evidenced by the loss of beta-glucan concentration and integrity.",1021,99,-1,99,99,99,0,1,0,4,178
"The evaluation and development of validated models for the nonlinear viscoelastic (VE) behavior of materials is an important area of research, which has impact on a number of industrial processes including those in the food industry. Various nonlinear VE models have been developed over the years and evaluated for petroleum-based polymers, however, our understanding of the nonlinear VE behavior of biopolymers of industrial import lags our understanding of synthetic polymers. In the work reported herein, the nonlinear VE behavior of several cellulosic fiber gels prepared from either corn or oat hulls were investigated. The rheological properties were measured using a Rheometrics Series IV controlled-strain rheometer equipped with a cone and plate fixture. The measurements were conducted at 23 +/- 0.1 degreesC. The rheological data were interpreted using a strain separable K-BKZ type (Wagner) model with a damping function evaluated from stress relaxation data.

"The effects of molecular size on rheological properties of highly pure oat beta-glucans in solution and gel state were studied. The fine structure of the beta-glucan preparations was assessed by C-13-NMR spectroscopy and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) of the cellulosic oligomers released by the action of lichenase. The tri- and tetra-saccharides accounted for 90.8-96.4% of the total oligomers analyzed and the calculated molar ratios of trimers/tetramers varied between 1.95 and 2.30. Molecular size characterization was carried out with high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) combined with a refractive index detector; for samples with apparent molecular weight (M-w) of the peak fraction of the main eluting peak ranging between 35 and 250 x 10(3), the values of limiting viscosity ([eta]), critical concentration (c**) and coil overlap parameter (c**[eta]) were within 0.67-3.83 dl/g, 0.70-2.10 g/dl and 1.41-2.67, respectively. The shear thinning and viscoelastic behavior of fresh beta-glucan solutions were typical of a random coil type polysaccharide, and dependent on the molecular size and concentration of the polymer. On the other hand, time-dependent rheological behavior was revealed by thixotropic loop experiments for the lowest molecular size sample, implying the formation of intermolecular networks. All beta-glucan samples, except the preparation with the highest M-w, were able to form gels, as revealed by dynamic rheometry; with increasing M-w the gelation time increased and the gelation rate (I-E = [d(log G')/dt](max)) decreased. The gelation rate also increased with increasing concentration and gel curing temperatures reaching a maximum at similar to 25 -35 degreesC; for higher temperatures the I-E values decreased. The dependence of storage modulus on beta-glucan concentration (C) followed power law relationships; G' varied as C7.2-7.5.

"The fate of hexanal added to flours of five different grain varieties was studied. All the flours appeared to be capable in decreasing hexanal concentration, but the abilities of oat flours were clearly the best. Depending on the oat flour used, the rate of hexanal decrease was 2.45-2.73 mug hexanal min(-1) g(-1) flour when 100 mug of hexanal was added to 1 g flour. This ability was highest amongst oat flour fractions rich in protein and fiber, which originated from the aleurone layers. The time course of hexanal decrease followed typical first order kinetics and the reaction was susceptible to heat inactivation. Hexanoic acid was identified as the predominant product correlating with hexanal decrease. These observations suggested the presence of aldehyde dehydrogenase type activity in oat. Hexanal was also absorbed to oat matrix to some extent, but it became saturated relatively quickly. It was concluded that the aldehyde dehydrogenase type activity present in oat efficiently prevents the accumulation of short chain aldehydes that lead to off odours in oat products.

"Background: Findings about the effects of beta-glucan on serum lipoproteins are conflicting. Objective: The study investigated the effects of beta-glucan from oat bran in bread and cookies (study 1) and in orange juice (study 2) on serum lipoproteins in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects. Design: In Study 1, 48 subjects (21 men, 27 women) received for 3 wk control bread and cookies rich in wheat fiber. For the next 4 wk, by random assignment, 23 subjects continued to consume the control products, and 25 received bread and cookies rich in beta-glucan. Mean daily intake of beta-glucan was 5.9 g. Total dietary fiber intake did not differ significantly between the groups. In study 2, the same sources of control fiber and beta-glucan (5 g/d) as in study 1 were provided. For 2 wk, 25 of the original 48 subjects (10 men, 15 women) were randomly assigned to consume orange juice containing either wheat fiber (n = 13) or beta-glucan from oat bran (n = 12). After a washout period of 1 wk, dietary regimens were crossed over. Results: In study 1, the change in LDL cholesterol did not differ significantly (-0.12 mmol/L; P = 0.173) between the 2 groups. In study 2, the drink rich in P-glucan decreased LDL cholesterol by 0.26 +/- 0.07 mmol/L (6.7 +/- 1.8%; P = 0.001) and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol by 0.26 +/- 0.11 (5.4 +/- 2.1 %; P = 0.029) compared with the other drink.

"In several studies oats have been reported to be tolerated by coeliac patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the nutritional and symptomatic effects of including oats in the gluten-free diet, as well as the patients' subjective experiences. Twenty adult coeliac patients included large amounts of oats in their diet. Food intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, blood samples and body weight were examined and compared with examination at baseline. Diet compliance was checked monthly. The results are based on fifteen patients eating oats for 2 years plus three with only 6-months consumption. The median daily intake of oats was 93 (range 27-137) g/d, and the compliance was good. The mean intakes of Fe and dietary fibre increased (P<0.001) with the oat diet, as well as the intakes of thiamin and Zn (P<0.02). The bioavailability of Fe tended to decrease; this seems not to have influenced the Fe status. Temporary increased flatulence was experienced the first few weeks, as well as improved bowel function with oats in the diet. All patients who carried out the whole study period wanted to continue eating oats after the study, as they found that addition of oats in the gluten-free diet gave more variation, better taste and satiety. Oats improved the nutritional value of the gluten-free diet, had no negative effects on nutritional status and were appreciated by the subjects. Including oats can help coeliac patients following a strict gluten-free diet.",1026,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,237
"It has been observed that under certain conditions, acid-hydrolyzed oat (1-3)(1-4)-beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan) solutions will form gels. However, the optimum conditions for gelation have not been fully explored. In the current work, one of the factors involved in determining gel integrity, initial solubilization temperature, was investigated. Six percent dispersions of two samples of acid-hydrolyzed oat P-glucan of medium and low viscosity (M-w = 70,000 and 40,000 g/mol, respectively), were solubilized at 60, 70, 80 and 90 degreesC for 3 h with constant stirring. After solubilization, the samples were cooled to 25 degreesC and rheological measurements in flow mode showed that the viscosity decreased with increasing solubilization temperature. Size exclusion chromatography indicated that the decrease in viscosity resulted from better dispersion of aggregates rather than depolymerization. Solutions dissolved at higher temperatures gelled more slowly at 4 degreesC and had a lower storage modulus after 4 and 7 days. The lower molecular weight sample gelled more quickly and had a higher storage modulus after 4 and 7 days than the higher molecular weight sample. Thus, solubilizing acid-hydrolyzed oat beta-glucan solutions at higher temperatures tend to more fully disperse the gum and disrupt small aggregates which may act as nucleation sites for gel formation.

"Oat beta-glucans were extracted (water at 47 degreesC) from milled seeds of two Greek cultivars (A. sativa cv. Pallini and A. bysantina cv. Kassandra) and partially purified by pH adjustment of the beta-glucan solutions to 4.5. Chemical analysis of the extracted gums revealed that they were composed mainly of beta-glucans (>85% d.b.) together with some contaminating proteins (<9% d.b.). The fine structure of the beta-glucan preparations was assessed by C-13-NMR spectroscopy and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography of the cellulosic oligomers released by the action of lichenase. The tri- and tetra-saccharides accounted for 90.9-92.3% of the total oligomers analyzed and the calculated molar ratios of trimers/tetramers varied between 1.99-2.11. Molecular size characterization was carried out with high performance size exclusion chromatography combined with a multi-angle laser light scattering and a refractive index detector; for samples with weight average molecular weight (M-w) ranging between 0.27 and 0.78 X 10(6), the values of limiting viscosity ([eta]), critical concentration (c**) and coil overlap parameter (c**[eta]) were within 4.9-6.4 dl/g, 1.2-2.0 g/dl and 7.8-10.1, respectively.

"Thirteen Bifidobacterium strains were isolated form the faeces of healthy elderly subjects. The ability of the isolated strains to acidify and survive in an oat-based medium was assessed and compared to a commercial starter Bifidobacterium strain. Since adhesion to the intestinal mucosa is one of the main selection criteria for potential probiotics, the influence of the oat medium on the ex vivo adhesion of the isolates to both human colonic tissue and to mucus from elderly subjects was assessed. Seven of the fourteen strains survived the 24-h fermentation, six of these acidified the medium to below pH 5. Supplementation of the medium with soy protein had a negative effect on survival and the acidification. The strains isolated from the elderly subjects were found to adhere in high levels to immobilised intestinal mucus from elderly. However, their adhesion to colonic tissue was significantly lower. Prior exposure to the oat-based medium increased the adhesion of two of the strains. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",1029,1,-1,-1,0,0,1,2,2,0,165
"The in vitro bile acid binding by rice bran, oat bran, dehulled barley, and beta-glucan enriched barley was determined using a mixture of bile acids at a duodenal physiological pH of 6.3. Six treatments and two blank incubations were conducted testing substrates on an equal protein basis. The relative in vitro bile acid binding of the cereal brans on an equal total dietary fiber (TDF) and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) basis considering cholestyramine as 100% bound was rice bran 45 and 49%; oat bran 23 and 30%; dehulled barley 33 and 57%; and beta-glucan enriched barley 20 and 40%, respectively. Bile acid bindings on equal protein basis for the respective cereals were 68, 26, 41, and 49%. Bile acid binding by rice bran may account to a great extent for its cholesterol-lowering properties, while bile acid binding by oat bran suggests that the primary mechanism of cholesterol lowering by oat bran is not due to the bile acid binding by its soluble fiber. Bile acid binding was not proportional to the soluble fiber content of the cereal brans tested. Except for dehulled barley, bile acid binding for rice bran, oat bran, and beta-glucan enriched barley appear to be related to their IDF content. Highest relative bile acid binding values for rice bran and beta-glucan enriched barley were observed on an equal protein basis, whereas highest values for dehulled barley were based on IDF. Data suggest that of all four cereals tested, bile acid binding may be related to IDF or protein anionic, cationic, physical and chemical structure, composition, metabolites, or their interaction with active binding sites.",1030,99,1,1,0,1,3,0,1,1,266
"Concentrations of avenanthramides and activity of the biosynthetic enzyme hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:hydroxyanthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HHT) were analyzed in dry or, steeped nonmilled or milled, non-heat-treated (raw) or heat-treated oat samples (Avena sativa L.). Increased avenanthramide concentrations were found when intact raw groats were steeped. The increase was time- and temperature-dependent and maximal after 10 hr of steeping at 20degreesC. Continuous germination in air, after steeping, only contributed to a further increase in avenanthrantides when steeping times were shorter than 10 hr. Concentrations of avenanthramides and HHT activity were positively correlated during steeping of intact groats at 8 and 20degreesC. The increase in avenanthramides was suggested to be due to de novo synthesis and a whole grain structure seemed to be required as no increase was found when groats were milled before steeping. Avenanthramide levels also increased when heat-treated samples, lacking HHT activity, were steeped. This increase may be due to release of bound forms, possibly formed during the preceding heat treatment.",1031,99,99,99,0,0,0,0,2,3,159

Among eight different synthetic avenanthramides tested, the tentative enzyme had highest affinity for avenanthramides comprising caffeic and p-coumaric acids and lowest for those comprising sinapic and ferulic acids. The activity was found in samples from several oat cultivars and was equally pronounced in both bran and endosperm. flour of oats. Steeping of oat grains did not influence the reaction.",1032,0,0,99,0,1,1,0,3,1,114
"Groat per cent and milling yield are important quality traits of oat (Avena sativa L.); however, accurate testing for these traits using existing methods can be time-consuming and labour-intensive. In this study digital imaging analysis (DIA) was used to estimate the mass of mechanically dehulled oat constituents (hulls, undamaged and broken groats), replacing hand sorting and weighing of these constituents in a test method measuring groat per cent and milling yield. Groat per cent values estimated using DIA had a standard error of prediction (SEP) of 0.57 and a correlation coefficient of 0.995 compared to the manual method. Milling yield values estimated using DIA had a SEP of 0.98 and a correlation coefficient of 0.993 compared to the manual method. Incorporating DIA into the test method allowed considerable savings of time and labour in performing these tests. (C) Crown copyright 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"The cadmium (Cd) contents of oats (Avena sativa L.) in Finland were examined over a 3 year period in three types of trials: official variety, organic vs conventional cultivation, and nitrogen fertilization trials. Large seasonal and regional variations were found in the Cd concentrations. In official variety trials, the mean Cd contents in 1997, 1998, and 1999 were 0.046, 0.029, and 0.052 mg kg(-1) dry weight (dw), respectively, ranging from 0.008 to 0.120 mg kg(-1) dw. The concentrations were generally well below the maximum permitted level of 0.100 mg kg(-1) fresh weight. No significant differences were found between the organic and the conventional cultivation techniques. Nitrogen (N) fertilization increased the Cd contents of oats especially at high nitrogen rates (160 kg N hectare(-1) (ha)). Significant cultivar differences (p < 0.001) were determined in all trials. Cultivars Salo and Kolbu had consistently higher contents, and Belinda and Roope had lower Cd contents among the different growing conditions.

"Aim: To evaluate the influence of wheat bran and oat bran on the oxidative stress induced by a high proportion of fat in the diet. Methods: Forty-eight growing pigs were penned individually and after an adaptation period divided into four groups. All groups received isocaloric daily rations composed of basal diet which was then supplemented with: starch (controls; CONT), linseed oil (OIL), linseed oil and wheat bran, or linseed oil and oat bran. The experimental period lasted 14-days. The oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring the malondialelehyde (MDA) concentration in blood plasma, the 48-hour urinary MDA excretion, and the degree of leukocyte nuclear DNA damage. Results: In comparison with the CONT group, a significant increase in the MDA concentration in blood plasma and in the MDA excretion in urine was found in the OIL group. The degree of DNA damage in the OIL group was also significantly higher. In comparison with the OIL group, the wheat bran and oat bran supplementation significantly reduced the 24-hour MDA excretion in urine and reduced the degree of DNA damage in leukocytes to the level of the CONT group. Conclusion: The results of the experiments confirmed that a high wheat bran and oat bran intake effectively reduces oxidative stress induced by a high-fat diet. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

"The shelf life of processed oat products and the usability of oats in modern food formulations are in many cases still limited by the lipid-associated deterioration. To elucidate the role of lipase inactivation in the development of rancidity in oats, heat treatments varying in severity were applied. Effects of these treatments on lipase activity and lipid oxidation were studied either directly after processing by mixing the fractions in water or after a long-term storage of dry fractions. A trend was found, that the lower the residual lipase activity in whole kernels or kernel fractions, the higher was the oxidation of lipids and evolution of volatile oxidation products during prolonged storage of the dry fractions. If bran was heat-treated to zero lipase activity, the amount of headspace hexanal detected after 12-month storage was 5 to 7 times larger than detected in non-heat treated bran. This formation of hexanal was linked to the oxidation of polar lipids. If the heat treatment was totally omitted, the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in polar lipids did not occur even during prolonged storage. The oxidation of polar lipids suggests heat-induced disintegration of membrane structures and inactivation of heat labile antioxidants. This study identifies heat treatments as critical control points in obtaining oat products with enhanced self-stability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial evaluated the influence of low fat, low saturated fat food products that contained free tall oil-based phytosterols (TOP) and oat beta-glucan (from whole oats and bran concentrate) on serum lipid concentrations in adults with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia. After a 5-wk National Cholesterol Education Program Step I diet lead-in period, 112 subjects incorporated one of two treatments into their diets for 6 wk: food products (cereal, snack bar and beverage) that provided 1.8 g TOP and 2.8 g beta-glucan/d and contained less than or equal to3.0 g total fat and less than or equal to1.0 g saturated fat (TOP/beta-glucan treatment) or similar control foods. The serum LDL cholesterol response from baseline to the end of study was significantly larger in the TOP/beta-glucan treated group than in the control group, in which there was no change (-3.7 vs. 0.4%; P = 0.013). Likewise, total cholesterol decreased in the TOP/beta-glucan treatment group and did not change significantly in the controls (-2.3 vs. 0.8%; P = 0.043). Serum HDL cholesterol and triglyceride responses did not differ between the groups. The results of this trial suggest that consumption of a group of low fat, TOP and beta-glucan-containing foods is a useful adjunct in the dietary management of hypercholesterolemia.",1038,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,207
"Whether oats should be included in a gluten-free diet has-been debated for half a century. In 1995, the largest and most scientifically rigorous study on the safety of oats was published. Investigators concluded that the consumption of oats was safe for adults with celiac disease. Since 1995, several additional studies have been published. Without exception, these investigations found no adverse effects, associated with. the, regular consumption of moderate amounts of oats. However, there are,concerns among some authorities on celiac disease that even if oats themselves are safe, they nonetheless may be contaminated with wheat,rye, or barley. Unfortunately, the extent to which contamination of commercial oat products occurs is not known.

"The effect of phytic acid on the solubility of mineral elements in oat bran was studied by digesting phytic acid with phytase enzyme. The combined effect of phytase treatment and the addition of three chelating agents common in food were also tested. Starch and proteins were digested enzymatically. The sample was dialysed, using an equilibrium dialysis method, and the soluble mineral elements were analysed from the dialyzate. The minerals studied were calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, zinc, potassium and phosphorus. The chelating agents used were citric and malic acids and glucose. The phytase treatment increased the solubility of minerals less than expected. Citric acid was the most efficient chelating agent. The effect of malic acid was small. The results confirmed that the minerals were tightly bound to the dietary fibre of oat bran and were only partially released when the influence of phytic acid was reduced by degradation.

"The cholesterol-lowering activities of oats and barley are commonly attributed to the beta-glucan fractions. Although beta-glucan is present in both grains and appears to be chemically similar, the effect of source on cholesterol-lowering activity has not been evaluated. In the present study, the antiatherogenic properties of beta-glucan concentrates from oats and barley were evaluated in Syrian golden F,B hamsters consuming a semi-purified hypercholesterolemic diet (HCD) containing cholesterol (0.15 g/100 g), hydrogenated coconut oil (20 g/100 g) and cellulose (15 g/100 g). After a 2-wk lead-in period, control hamsters were fed the HCD, whereas experimental hamsters consumed HCD formulated to include p-glucan (2, 4, or 8 g/100 g) by addition of beta-glucan concentrate prepared from oats or barley at the expense of cellulose. Compared with control hamsters, dose-dependent decreases that were similar in magnitude in plasma total and LDL cholesterol concentrations were observed in hamsters fed beta-glucan from either source at wk 3, 6 and 9. Compared with controls, liver cholesterol concentrations were also reduced (P < 0.05) in hamsters consuming 8 g/100 g oat or barley P-glucan. In agreement with previously proposed mechanisms, total fecal neutral sterol concentrations were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in hamsters consuming 8 g/100 g barley or oat P-glucan. Aortic cholesterol ester concentrations were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in hamsters fed 8 g/100 g beta-glucan from barley or oats. Although aortic total cholesterol and cholesterol ester concentrations were significantly correlated with LDL cholesterol (r = 0.565, P < 0.004 and r = 0.706, P < 0.0001, respectively), this association could explain only half of the variability.

"Eight avenanthramides, amides of anthranilic acid (1) and 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (2), respectively, and the four cinnamic acids p-coumaric (p), caffeic (c), ferulic (f), and sinapic (s) acid, were synthesized for identification in oat extracts and for structure-antioxidant activity studies. Three compounds (2p, 2c, and 2f) were found in oat extracts. As assessed by the reactivity toward 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), all avenanthramides except 1 p showed activity. Initially, the antioxidant activity of the avenanthramides decreased in a similar order as for the corresponding cinnamic acids, that is: sinapic > caffeic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. The avenanthramides derived from 2 were usually slightly more active than those derived from 1.

"Sensory texture and flavor parameters of three formulations of two popular cookies were evaluated by a trained descriptive panel. Probing, a puncture test, was used to assess texture instrumentally. Other physical tests included water activity, cookie spread, and specific gravity. Chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies were prepared using a nonsucrose sweetener blend (dextrose/acesulfame-K) or prune puree, following manufacturers' recommendations, to replace 50% of the sugar or fat, respectively. The three formulations differed in ratios of flour, sugar, fat, and water. Instrumental and sensory evaluations occurred the day after baking. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and means separation tests (P < 0.05). Relationships between sensory and instrumental assessments were identified with correlations. According to the trained panel, sugar and fat replacement had a greater effect on texture than on flavor. Probing was successfully used to assess textural attributes of cookies.

"While consumption of diets high in fiber is perceived to result in undesirable gastrointestinal symptoms, the fermentation of undigested carbohydrate in the large intestine may, in fact, have beneficial health effects. In this study, we compared the effects of oats, barley, and their extracts with a glucose control for 24 hr on breath hydrogen and methane production as a marker of colonic fermentation and also assessed gastrointestinal symptoms. Nine men and 11 women (35-57 yr) consumed 1 g/kg of body weight of carbohydrate as glucose or 0.66 g/kg of body weight sugar and 0.33 g/kg of body weight as oat bran, barley flour, oat extracts, or barley extract (Nu-trimX) in a Latin square design. Expired alveolar breath samples were collected after instruction at fasting, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 24 hr after consumption of the test meals. All test meals increased breath hydrogen and methane (both P < 0.0001). Hydrogen, but not methane, responses to barley, oats, and extracts of each were higher (barley > oats, P < 0.05) than responses to glucose (P < 0.0001).

Order of treatment was randomly assigned. Glycemic responses were calculated using the trapezoid method. Data were analyzed using mixed procedure analysis of variance program. Glucose responses to oats, barley, and both extracts, and areas under the curve were significantly tower than responses to the glucose solution (P < 0.0001). Insulin responses for the barley extract were lowest and were significantly lower than for glucose solution.

"Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether adult patients with coeliac disease in remission could include large amounts of oats in their daily gluten-free diet for an extended period of time without adverse effects. Design, subjects and methods: Twenty adult coeliac patients in remission included large amounts of uncontaminated rolled oats in their daily diet for a prolonged period. The examinations, performed four times during the study period, included small bowel endoscopy with biopsies, blood samples (nutritional status, serological analysis), height and body weight, gastrointestinal symptoms and dietary records. Gastrointestinal symptoms and diet were also investigated through unannounced telephone interviews once a month during the study period. Results: No adverse effects of a large intake of oats were seen in small bowel histology, serology nor in nutritional status in the 15 subjects who completed the whole study period. Two of the subjects dropped out because of gastrointestinal symptoms and three for non-medical reasons. The median intake of oats was 93 g/day and the compliance to the oat diet was found to be good. Examinations of the patients after drop-out did not show any deterioration in small bowel histology or nutritional status nor raised levels of antibodies. Conclusion: Results from this study indicate that adult patients with coeliac disease in remission can include large amounts of controlled wheat-free rolled oats for an extended period of time without adverse effects.

"Hydroxycinnamic acids, mainly ferulic and p-coumaric acids, are believed to be inhibitory to ruminal biodegradability of complex cell wall materials such as oat hulls. Previous studies have shown that a novel enzyme, Aspergillus ferulic acid esterase, and Trichoderma xylanase act synergistically to break the ester linkage between ferulic acid and the attached sugar of feruloyl polysaccharides, releasing ferulic acid from oat hulls. In this paper, we examined the enzymic release of reducing sugars from oat hulls by the actions of individual enzymes (Aspergillus ferulic acid esterase at 13 mU, 6.4 U, and 4678.4 U/assay; cellulase at 20 levels, ranging from 7.8 mU to 2772.7 U/assay; Trichoderma xylanase at 20 levels, ranging from 7.8 mU to 4096 U/assay) and by the combined action of cellulase at six levels (62.5 mU, 2 U, 16 U, 128 U, 1024 U, and 2772.7 U/assay), Aspergillus ferulic acid esterase at 13 mU/assay, and Trichoderma xylanase at two levels (1 U and 256 U/assay). The amount of total acid-extractable reducing sugars in the oat hulls used in this study was 793.8 +/- 8.0 mug/mg. The results show that after a 24-h incubation with Aspergillus ferulic acid esterase alone, no reducing sugars were observed to be released from oat hulls. With cellulase as the sole enzyme, as the concentration increased from 7.8 mU to 2772.7 U/assay, the release of reducing sugars increased (P < 0.01) from 0 to 39% of the total present, with the highest release at 512 U/assay. With Trichoderma xylanase alone, as the concentration increased from 7.8 mU to 4096 U/assay, the release of reducing sugars increased (P < 0.01) from 4.9 to 33%, with the highest release at 2048 U/assay. When incubated together with Trichoderma xylanase (1 U or 256 U/assay) and Aspergillus ferulic acid esterase (13 mU/assay), cellulase at all six levels (62.5 mU, 2 U, 16 U, 128 U, 1024 U and 2772.7 U/assay) significantly increased the release of reducing sugars (P < 0.01) from 8 to 69%.

"A rheological study was conducted to determine the functional properties of a hydrocolloidal blend of soybean flour and oat bran, called Soytrim. Soytrim was prepared by thermomechanically processing soybean and oat products. After finding that Soytrim had similar rheological characteristics to coconut and soybean milk products, two studies were conducted to investigate its use in improving the nutritional value of some Asian foods by reducing the saturated fat content and increasing the soluble fibre content. In the first study, four Thai foods were prepared using a 60 g kg(-1) Soytrim suspension to replace some of the coconut milk, with subsequent sensory, chemical and physical analysis. A 750 g kg(-1) substitution of Soytrim for coconut milk in green chicken curry gave a 74.7% reduction in saturated fat content and a 142.8% increase in soluble fibre content. Total substition of Soytrim for coconut milk in fermented soybean dip gave a 96.2% reduction in saturated fat and a 10.6% increase in soluble fibre. Total substitution in mungbean conserve gave a 97.0% reduction in saturated fat and a 19.0% increase in soluble fibre. A 500 g kg(-1) substitution of soytrim for coconut milk in sweetened condensed cassava paste gave a 48.7% reduction in saturated fat and 37.5% increase in soluble fibre. Sensory evaluation of these foods revealed no distinguishable changes in acceptability at the 500 g kg(-1) replacement level, but unacceptability with total substitution. In the second study, more widely consumed Asian foods, soymilk and tofu, were combined with Soytrim. These foods could also be made more nutritious when combined with Soytrim at rates of substitution up to 300 g kg(-1), with satisfactory acceptability at this replacement level. In all the Asian foods studied, the hydrocolloidal blend of soybean flour and oat bran could add nutritional value by reducing saturated fat and increasing soluble fibre.

"Background: Oat bran contains soluble fibers, such as beta-glucan, that increase bile acid excretion and thus decrease serum cholesterol. Bile acid synthesis correlates with serum concentrations of the metabolite 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (alpha-HC). Objective: The objective was to investigate whether consumption of beta-glucan from oat bran increases bile acid synthesis, as measured by the serum alpha-HC concentration, within hours after consumption in response to the loss of bile acids from the liver. Design: In a randomized, single-blind, wheat bran-controlled study with crossover design, 8 subjects were served a controlled diet during 2 periods of 3 d each, with an 11-d washout between the periods. Breakfast included either 75 g extruded oat bran, of which 11 g was beta-glucan, or 75 g wheat bran, of which 1 g was beta-glucan. alpha-HC was measured by HPLC on each day at 0, 12, and 24 h after breakfast and also at 8 h after breakfast on the first day. Results: After 8 and 12 h of the oat bran diet period, the serum alpha-HC concentration was 84% (P = 0.012) and 92% (P = 0.017) higher, respectively, than that before breakfast. Serum concentrations returned to the baseline value after 24 It. Wheat bran did not influence serum alpha-HC concentrations. Conclusions: Consumption of beta-glucan from oat bran nearly doubled the serum alpha-HC concentration within 8 h, indicating increased bile acid synthesis. alpha-HC in serum could be used as a marker of increased bile acid excretion induced by the diet.",1052,1,1,99,1,0,3,0,1,1,243
"To evaluate the mechanical behavior of groats with constant mass and moisture content, individual groats were compressed along the major axis between parallel flat plates. Compression versus tension testing was adapted easily to groats, which are weaker along the major axis. Regression of maximum apparent stress on moisture content suggested that the proportionality constant was a function of an undefined biological difference (UBD) among tested samples and the y-intercept depended on groat mass and UBD. No brittle-ductile transition in the range of 9-30% moisture was observed regardless of genotype. Groats in general tended to fail by plastic, compression at low moisture content (9-10%). Groats at high moisture content (>12%) generally buckled and burst near the midpoint of the crease, suggesting higher stress around the crease regardless of genotype. Apparent maximum stress should be considered as an average for a genotype.

"Oat damage has negative effects on milling yield and finished product quality. Interrelationships among groat characteristics and mechanical behavior were analyzed to better understand groat damage caused by impact dehulling (ID). Regression of the natural logarithm (In) of apparent stiffness (S-max) on the contents of ferulic acid, syringic acid, and moisture suggests that ferulic acid or perhaps diferulate cross-links increase groat stiffness, and syringic acid or perhaps syringate derivatives and moisture decrease groat stiffness. Polymer cross-linking decreases extensibility, and moisture (a plasticizer) softens polymers. Regression of In of apparent toughness (T) on beta-glucan and protein content implies that both polymers increase groat toughness. beta-glucan is a cell-wall polymer, and the cell wall is known to confer toughness. The location of these polymers (perhaps concentrated in the bran) may also confer toughness. Regression of ln(ID) on moisture content, starch content, and T/S-max suggests that moisture decreases impact damage (as does T/S-max), and starch increases damage. Starch may act like filler, increasing stiffness and damage. According to the ratio of T/S-max, groats must be tough but not too stiff for low levels of damage.",1054,99,-1,-1,-1,99,0,3,0,2,182

The following sequence of mineral components released was observed: Cu (57.2-95.6%) > P (39.7-60.9%) > Ca (18.2-39.5%) > Mg (16.4-39.8%) > Mn (6.4-24.7%) > Fe (6.5-29%) > Zn (11-17.2%). The Ca/P ratio in the supernatant worsened from 1:8.2 in crushed oat to 1:23.3 in extruded oat and corn crisps. Crushed oat released the highest amounts of mineral elements during enzymatic hydrolysis, with oat grouts coming second. As regards the other products, it is difficult to establish their relative sequence in the release of minerals. (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.",1056,99,99,99,0,99,0,0,1,4,306
"Commercial extracts of oats containing relatively hydrophilic phenolic compounds (including avenanthramides) were provided. They were generated using 50% ethanol as the extracting solvent, concentrated, and raised up in 50% aqueous butane chol (9G3, 9F1, 0C4). A more hydrophobic extract, fractionated into polar/amphiphilic lipids (including tocols), was generated using IPA (isopropanol) and designated the IPApolar extract Two approaches were used to measure the antioxidant activity of oat extracts: the quenching of free radicals and the inhibition of human LDL (low density lipoprotein) oxidation. Results indicated that the order of antioxidant activity of the extracts was broadly similar for each of the methods used Notably the order of decreasing antioxidant activity per unit mass of phenolics, as obtained from the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assays and LDL oxidation assays, was IPApolar > 0C4 > 9F1 > 9G3. FTCL (flow-through chemiluminescence) data were very similar, only showing a shift in the relative activity position of 0C4 from second to third. Interestingly, alpha-tocopherol and Trolox showed very similar activity per mole in the DPPH assay, but Trolox was more active in the FTCL and LDL, oxidation assays.

"Background: No studies have examined whether increased consumption of oat cereal; rich in soluble fiber, favorably alters lipoprotein particle size and number. Objective: We examined the effects of large servings of either oat or wheat cereal on plasma lipids, lipoprotein subclasses, lipoprotein particle diameters, and LDL particle number. Design: Thirty-six overweight men aged 50-75 y were randomly assigned to consume daily for 12 wk either oat or wheat cereal providing 14 g dietary fiber/d. Before and after the intervention, plasma lipid and lipoprotein subclasses were measured with proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and whole-body insulin sensitivity was estimated with the frequently sampled intravenous-glucose-tolerance test. Results: Time-by-treatment interactions (P < 0.05) for LDL cholesterol (oat: -2.5%; wheat: 8.0%), small LDL cholesterol (oat: -17.3%; wheat: 60.4%), LDL particle number (oat: -5.0%; wheat: 14.2%), and LDL:HDL cholesterol (oat: -6.3%; wheat: 14.2%) were observed. Time-by-treatment interactions were nearly significant for total cholesterol (oat: -2.5%; wheat: 6.3%; P = 0.08), triacylglycerol (oat: -6.6%; wheat: 22.0%; P = 0.07), and VLDL triacylglycerol (oat: -7.6%; wheat: 2.7%; P = 0.08). No significant time-by-treatment interactions were observed for HDL cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol subclasses, or LDL, HDL, and VLDL particle diameters. Insulin sensitivity did not change significantly with either intervention. Conclusions: The oat compared with the wheat cereal produced lower concentrations of small, dense LDL cholesterol and LDL particle number without producing adverse changes in blood triacylglycerol or HDL-cholesterol concentrations. These beneficial alterations may contribute to the cardioprotective effect of oat fiber.",1058,1,1,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,242
"Oat kernel size uniformity is important to the oat milling industry because of the size fractionations that occur in the milling process. We measured frequency of single, double. and triple kernel spikelets and kernel mass of primary, secondary, and tertiary kernels from each spikelet type (for a total of six kernel types) to determine relative influence of kernel type, panicle position, genotype, and environment on oat kernel size for 10 oat cultivars grown at four locations. Kernel type was the most important factor affecting kernel size. Primary kernels front triple kernel spikelets were larger than primary kernels from double kernel spikelets. Tertiary kernels were the smallest. Environments that produced larger kernels also produced higher frequencies of triple kernel spikelets. Some genotypes produced no triple kernel spikelets in any environment, whereas others produced varying proportions, depending on the environment. Kernels closer to the top of the particle were larger than those near the base. The presence of tertiary kernels was neither associated with lower groat percentage,, nor with increased proportions, of undersized kernels. Most undersized kernels were kernel types other than tertiary.",1059,0,99,99,99,0,0,0,2,3,181
"Expanded extrudates were produced from pork meat (20%)-defatted soy flour (25%)-corn starch mixture, with or without additional ingredients: onion powder (1%), alone or in combination with carrot powder (1.5%) or extract (1.5%), or defatted oat flour (5%). Dried extrudates stored aerobically at 37 degreesC for 0, 15, 30, or 60 d were evaluated for thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) measured at 450 nm (TBARS@450) and 530 nm (TBARS@530) and for peroxide value (PV). Both TBARS@450 and TBARS@530 were not useful for assessment of either the ingredients or storage time effect. PV decreased between d 0 and d 30 for some products.

"Hydration of oat bran including fermentation by rye sourdough was studied. Three types of oat bran suspensions were prepared (a control, one with whole meal rye flour added, and one with rye starter added). The suspensions were incubated for 1, 2, 3 and 4 hr. beta-Glucan content and solubilities of protein and beta-glucan were analyzed. Viscosity of the supernatants of oat bran suspensions was determined. Neither the rye sourdough nor the rye flour alone had a significant. effect on the total beta-glucan content of oat bran suspensions. However, the addition of rye, either as whole meal rye flour or as sourdough starter, markedly increased the solubility of beta-glucan and proteins and simultaneously decreased the viscosity of the water-soluble fraction of oat bran suspension. This suggests that a hydrolysis of beta-glucan had occurred that could change the rheological properties of oat bran in baking and the physiological potential of oat bran in nutrition.",1061,0,99,99,0,1,1,0,2,2,152
"Changes in the sensory attributes, lipid composition, and amounts of volatile and phenolic compounds of native and processed (germinated and dried) crushed oat were followed during a 12-month storage period. The influence of the chemical attributes on the sensory profiles of oats was analyzed by statistical multivariate techniques (PLS regression). During the storage period, significant changes in the sensory profiles of the native and processed oat groats were observed. The stability of oat groats was significantly increased through germination and subsequent drying because the chemical changes causing rancidity and bitterness developed more slowly in the processed oat when compared with the native oat. In native oat, the most intensive changes due to deterioration had already occurred after one month of storage, whereas in processed oat, these changes were perceived considerably later. Stored oat that had deteriorated was evaluated as being musty and earthy in odor and bitter and rancid in flavor. The accumulation of free fatty acids and volatile compounds related to lipid oxidation were closely correlated with the development of the undesired sensory attributes described above. The total amount of phenolic compounds, as well as the volatile aromatic and branched chain compounds derived mainly from protein degradation, showed a significant relationship with favorable sensory attributes such as roasted odor and flavor. Lipid oxidation occurred during the storage and was observed both in the polar and in the nonpolar lipid classes of native oat, whereas in the processed oat, these changes were nonsignificant. Photo-oxidation of acylated fatty acids may significantly contribute to the development of volatile lipid oxidation products during storage.",1062,99,99,99,1,99,1,0,0,4,261
"Fermentation by human fecal bacteria of fractions of wheat bran prepared by preprocessing technology were examined and compared with a beta-glucan-rich oat bran and a purified beta-glucan (OG). The wheat fractions were essentially a beeswing bran (WBA), mainly insoluble dietary fiber, and an aleurone-rich fraction (WBB) containing more soluble fiber and some beta-glucan (2.7%). The oat bran (OB) had more endosperm and was very rich in beta-glucan (21.8%). Predigestion of WBB and OB to mimic the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract gave digested wheat bran fraction B (WBBD) and digested oat bran (OBD), respectively. These predigested fractions were fermented in a batch technique using fresh human feces under anaerobic conditions. Changes in pH, total gas and hydrogen production, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and both soluble and insoluble beta-glucan. and other polysaccharide components, as determined from analysis of monosaccharide residues, were monitored. Fractions showed increasing fermentation in the order WBA<WBBD<OBD<OG. Variations in SCFA production indicated that microbial growth and metabolism were different for each substrate. Polysaccharide present in the supernatant of the digests had disappeared after 4 hr of fermentation. Fermentability of oat and wheat &beta;-glucan reflected solubility differences, and both sources of &beta;-glucan were completely fermented in 24 hr. Although the overall patterns of fermentation indicated the relative amounts of soluble and insoluble fiber, the anatomical origin of the tissues played a major role, presumably related to the degree of lignification and other association with noncarbohydrate components.",1063,99,0,99,99,0,0,0,2,3,237

"Concentrations and compositions of total lipids (TL), fatty acids, tocopherols and tocotrienols, avenanthramides and free hydroxycinnamic acids were determined in groats and hulls from single samples of seven Swedish oat cultivars. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured using the radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl as substrate. Results were evaluated by principal component analysis. Consistent differences in value of the variables analysed in groats and hulls were found, groats having higher concentrations of all compounds analysed except free cinnamic acids. Concentrations of E-vitamers (especially tocotrienols) were high in both groat and hull samples with high TL. Avenanthramides were high in hull samples with high TL, but this was not found in groats. Free cinnamic acids did not follow TL in either groats or hulls. TAC was generally higher in groats than in hulls. The within-group variation in TAC was less pronounced than that in chemical composition, especially in groats. The results did not suggest any strong relationship between TAC and individual antioxidants. (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.",1065,0,99,99,1,0,1,0,2,2,164
"The content of zearalenone and its metabolites in urine and tissue samples from pigs fed zearalenone-contaminated oats was established by analytical methods combining solid-phase extraction cleanup of the samples with highly selective liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS detection. Investigation of the urine samples revealed that approximately 60% of zearalenone was transformed in vivo to a-zearalenol and its epimer beta-zearalenol in a mean ratio of 3:1. Zeranol and taleranol as further metabolites could only be detected in trace amounts. Zearalanone was identified at considerable concentrations, though only in a couple of samples, In contrast, liver samples contained predominantly a-zearalenol, and to a minor extent beta-zearalenol and zearalenone, with a mean ratio of alpha-/beta-zearalenol of 2.5:1, while zeranol, taleranol, or zearalanone could not be identified in any of the investigated samples. The degree of glucoronidation was established for zearalenone as 27% in urine and 62% in liver; for alpha-zearalenol as 88% in urine and 77% in liver-, and for beta-zearalenol as 94% in urine and 29% in liver. Analyses of muscle tissue revealed relatively high amounts of nonglucuronidated zeranol and a-zearalenol together with traces of taleranol and zearalenone, indicating that the metabolism of zearalenone and its metabolites is not restricted to hepatic and gastrointestinal metabolic pathways.",1066,-1,99,0,99,1,1,1,1,2,203

SDS-PAGE showed that the oat globulin acidic polypeptides (AP) were more susceptible to polymerization than the basic polypeptides (BP), and the reactivities of both AP and BP were enhanced by the addition of other substrate proteins. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that both the denaturation temperature and denaturation enthalpy were decreased after TG treatment. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed marked increases in the intensity of two intermolecular beta-sheet bands associated with aggregate formation but little conformational changes in the polymerized protein.

"We determined copper, zinc and cobalt sorption by oat and its products under variable pH conditions as well as the content of neutral dietary fiber (NDF) and its fractional composition. Adsorbents in a model sorption system were oat, dehulled oat, oats bran and oats flakes. Three various buffers (pH 1.8, 6.6 and 8.7) were used as dispersing solutions, Results collected during this study indicate that copper, zinc and cobalt sorption is significantly affected by the type of cereal raw material, Zinc and copper ions are subjected to higher sorption than cobalt ions, Examined metal ions were Subjected to high sorption under conditions corresponding to the duodenum environment (pH 8.7). regardless of the kind of adsorbent, A little lower sorption capacity is observed under conditions close to the neutral environment, while the lowest one is found in environment reflecting conditions of stomach juice (pH 1.8).

"The effects of various commercial hydrothermal processes (steaming, autoclaving, and drum drying) on levels of selected oat antioxidants were investigated, Steaming and flaking of dehulled oat groats resulted in moderate losses of tocotrienols, caffeic acid, and the avenanthramide Bp (N-(4'-hydroxy)(E)-cinnamoyl-5-hydroxy-anthranilic acid), while ferulic acid and vanillin increased. The tocopherols and the avenanthramides Bc (N-(3',4'-dihydroxy-(E)-cinnamoyl-5-hydroxy-anthranilic acid) and Bf (N-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy) -(E)-cinnamoyl-5-hydroxy-anthranilic acid) were not affected by steaming. Autoclaving of grains (including the hulls) caused increased levels of all tocopherols and tocotrienols analyzed except beta-tocotrienol, which was not affected. Vanillin and ferulic and p-coumaric acids also increased, whereas the avenanthramides decreased, and caffeic acid was almost completely eliminated. Drum drying of steamed rolled oats resulted in an almost complete loss of tocopherols and tocotrienols, as well as a large decrease in total cinnamic acids and avenanthramides.

"Oat hulls, an agricultural byproduct, contain a relatively high amount of ferulic acid (FA; 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid), which is believed to be inhibitory to oat hull biodegradability by rumen microorganisms. In this paper, Aspergillus ferulic acid esterase (FAE) was investigated for its ability to release FA from oat hulls. The objectives were to determine the effects of particle size of oat hulls (ground to pass through 1 mm and 250 mum screens and a 100 mum sieve) on release of FA by FAE both in the presence and in the absence of Trichoderma xylanase. The results show that the release of FA by FAE was dependent upon the particle size of oat hulls (less than or equal to250 mum). In the absence of Trichoderma xylanase, little FA was released by FAE. In the presence of Trichoderma xylanase, there was a significant release of FA by FAE, indicating a synergistic interaction between FAE and Trichoderma xylanase on release of FA from oat hulls. These results indicate that FAE is able to break the ester linkage between FA and the attached sugar, releasing FA from oat hulls. This may leave the remainder of the polysaccharides open for further hydrolytic attack by rumen microorganisms. It is likely that removing FA from oat hulls could improve rumen biodegradability, thus improving the nutritional value of oat hulls.",1071,1,-1,1,99,99,2,1,0,2,221
"Four strains of lactic acid bacteria were used as pure or mixed cultures to investigate the texture-promoting capacity and exopolysaccharides (EPS) formation in three different oat-based, non-dairy milk products, Adavena G40, Adavena M40 (both with a dry matter content of 20%) and Mill Milk (with a dry matter content of 10%). Viscosity was measured at two different shear rates during 2 min of shear thinning. The highest viscosity was measured at a shear rate of 129 s(-1) when a mixed culture consisting of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCFB 2772 and Lactobacillus brevis DSM 1269 was grown at 30degreesC in the medium containing mostly glucose as the carbohydrate source (Adavena G40). The mixed culture consisting of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCFB 2772 and Streptococcus thermophilus DSM 20259 gave the highest viscosity when using the medium with a dry matter content of 20% and maltose as the main carbohydrate source (Adavena M40). The EPS formation in the Adavena G40 medium was confirmed by isolating the soluble polymer fraction after fermentation. A higher yield of polymer dry mass was obtained from the samples with higher viscosity. The study shows that the eo-operative growth that occurs when using mixed cultures also influences the EPS formation and final viscosity in the different oat-based media.

"The results of epidemiologic studies suggest that increased intake of dietary fiber is associated with lower levels of arterial blood pressure (BP). However, there is little information available addressing the possibility that increased oat consumption may reduce arterial BP in individuals with elevated arterial BP. To test this hypothesis, middle-aged and older men (n = 36; body mass index, 25-35 kg/m(2); aged 50-75 y) with elevated BP (systolic BP 130-159 mmHg and/or diastolic BP 85-99 mmHg) were randomly assigned to consume an additional 14 g/d of dietary fiber in the form of oat (5.5 g beta-glucan, n = 18) or wheat cereals (no beta-glucan, n = 18) for 12 wk. Casual resting arterial BP was measured at baseline and after 4, 8 and 12 wk of intervention. The 24-h ambulatory arterial BP was measured at baseline and after 12 wk of intervention. There were no differences in casual resting or 24-h ambulatory BP at baseline in the two groups. Casual systolic BP (SBP) did not change as a result of the 12-wk intervention in the oat (138 +/- 2 vs. 135 +/- 3 mmHg) or wheat (142 +/- 2 vs. 140 +/- 3 mmHg) groups, respectively (all P > 0.05). Casual diastolic BP (DBP) also did not change in the oat (89 +/- 2 vs. 88 +/- 2 mmHg) or wheat (90 +/- 2 vs. 91 +/- 2 mmHg) group during this period (all P > 0.05). Further, 24-h, daytime and nighttime SBP and DBP did not decrease with the intervention.

"The survival of the probiotic strains Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730, Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079 and Bifidobacterium bifidum DSM 20456, all of human origin, were investigated in three different oat-based, non-dairy products (Adavena M40, MG20 and G40). The products were fermented by the three strains with and without the presence of a commercial yoghurt culture (V2). Samples were stored at 6 degreesC up to 30 days. In general, the oat-based products were shown to be a suitable support for these intestinal bacteria. L. reuteri ATCC 55730 had the highest viability in all of the products investigated. After 30 days the cell viability of L. reuteri ATCC 55730 was 10(8) CFU ml(-1) in all three oat-based products. Lower viability was seen when the strains were grown in the presence of the yoghurt culture compared to when they were grown as pure cultures. These products also exhibited a lower pH value in comparison to products fermented with the pure cultures. The milisation of the main fermentable carbohydrates in the products varied across the bacterial strains. A decrease in beta-glucan content was seen for the products fermented by the B. bifidum DSM 20456 strain.

Analysis of beta-glucan for fine and coarse fractions for each milling speed indicated the highest. beta-ghtcan content was obtained infractions larger than 30 mum from 3 x 14,000 rpm. This fraction accounted for 393 g/kg of defatted oat bran, and it contained 188g/kg beta-glucan and 302g/kg protein. With further fractionation of this fraction by sieving, it was observed that fractions of particle size greater than 90 fun contained 18g/kg beta-glucan and less than 100 g/kg of starch.

"The determination of groat percentage in experimental oat breeding lines requires the dehulling of oats. Here, we report the results of our efforts to optimize dehulling conditions so that the most accurate and reliable result can be obtained. Hand dehulling was always reliable and accurate, however, it was the most time-consuming and tedious of the methods studied. Two mechanical methods of oat dehulling, compressed-air dehulling and impact dehulling, also frequently provided reliable results, however, results were strongly influenced by dehulling conditions. Optimal dehulling conditions represented compromises between unfavorable extremes. Correct aspiration strength was critical to accurate groat percentage determination. We have found that a secondary aspiration is highly desirable after compressed-air dehulling to remove hulls remaining with the groats after dehulling. Also, increased mechanical stress on oats as exerted either by the number of passes through the impact dehuller, or by the air pressure in the compressed-air dehuller, resulted in higher dehulling efficiency, but increased groat breakage as well. Dehulling efficiency decreased as moisture increased from 7.5 to 15%, but increased as moisture was further increased to 30%. In contrast, groat breakage with impact dehulling decreased as moisture increased from 7.5 to 30%. A new equation for goat percentage calculation has been introduced where the mass of hulled oats remaining after dehulling is subtracted from the mass of the original oat sample, so that poor dehulling efficiency does not influence the groat percentage.",1078,99,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,5,233
"Germination and subsequent drying of oat produced significantly different sensory profiles depending on processing parameters such as drying speed and temperature profile. The most salient sensory attributes for processed oat were roasted odor and flavor, sweet taste, intense odor, intense aftertaste, and hard, crisp, brittle texture (P < 0.05). High temperatures (>85 degreesC) were necessary to produce these sensory attributes, and quick drying after germination resulted in higher levels of intensity of favorable sensory attributes. The total amount of volatile compounds was higher in native (ungerminated) oat than in processed oat. During germination, and particularly during the drying treatment, the profile of volatile compounds changed. The most abundant volatile compounds responsible for odor were dimethyl sulfide, hexanal, pentanal, and isobutanal. The relative amount of dimethyl sulfide increased as a function of temperature in drying, whereas hexanal, pentanal, and isobutanal disappeared during heating, as did several other small ketones, alcohols, and esters. The germinated oat dried at high temperatures (65-93 degreesC and 65-85 degreesC) was perceived as being roasted, sweet, and nutty. Sensory and instrumental profile analyses of selected volatile compounds using partial least squares (PLS) regression techniques showed that these sensory attributes were clearly related to dimethyl sulfides and isobutanol. A moist and earthy odor was related to cymene, limonene, and isobutanal. Phenolic compounds significantly influenced oat flavor, whereas lipids had a negligible effect.",1079,99,99,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,224
"Germination can be used to improve the texture and flavor of cereals. However, germination generally causes breakdown of beta -glucans, which is undesirable with respect to the functional properties of beta -glucan. Our aim was to assess possibilities of germinating oat without substantial loss of high molecular weight beta -glucan. Two cultivars, hulled Veli and hullless (naked) Lisbeth were germinated at 5, 15, and 25 degreesC and dried by lyophilization or oven drying. Elevated germination temperatures led to an increase in Fusarium, aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, Pseudomonas spp., lactic acid bacteria, enterobacteria, and aerobic spore-forming bacteria. Therefore, the germination temperature should be kept low to avoid excessive growth of microbes. Of the samples germinated at 15 degreesC, only one contained low amounts of the Fusarium toxin deoxynivalenol (52 mug/kg). Germination led to the breakdown of beta -glucans, but the decrease in the molecular weight of beta -glucan was. initially very slow. A short germination schedule (72 hr, 15 degreesC) terminated with oven drying was developed to produce germinated oat with retained beta -glucan content.

Product hardness increased for bologna with both fiber types. The extent of product change, however, was different for the 2 oat fiber varieties.",1082,0,99,1,99,99,1,0,1,3,106
"Objectives To study possible synergistic effects of oats and soy on reducing total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations in human beings and the efficacy and feasibility of including these adjustments to a National Cholesterol Education Program Step I diet. Subject/setting One hundred twenty-seven postmenopausal women with moderate hypercholesterolemia were recruited from a large Midwestern workforce and senior centers in the surrounding community. Intervention and clinical visits were conducted in these same facilities. Design After a 3-week lead-in period on the Step I diet, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments for an additional 6 weeks: an oats/milk group, a wheat/soy group, an oats/soy group, and a wheat/milk group. Clinical measurements included blood draws, body weight and height, blood pressure, and medical history data. Three-day food records were collected at baseline and Weeks 3 and 9 of the intervention. Randomization was stratified based on the status of hormone replacement therapy and was blocked with sizes 4 or 8 for group assignment. Results After 3 weeks on the Step I diet, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels; total fat and saturated fat intake, dietary cholesterol intake, Keys score, and body mass index were all reduced. Following an additional 6 weeks on the Step I diet: plus intervention, total cholesterol and LDL-C were further reduced for both the oats/soy group and oats/milk group. There were no significant further changes hr total cholesterol, LDL-C, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the wheat/soy and wheat/milk groups. Body mass index remained stable in all groups from Week 3 to Week 9. Applications Nonpharmacologic dietary interventions like the Step I diet are feasible in a community setting and can produce rapid and significant lipid-lowering benefits. Daily consumption of 2 servings of oats can contribute to further lipid alterations in this population although soy intake at this dose may not. Palatab",1083,1,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,307
"In an attempt to develop a fermented, non-dairy product based on oats, a new kind of oat base, Adavena (R) M40, was fermented with two different yoghurt cultures. Adavena (R) M40 is a concentrated liquid (with a dry matter content of 16 or 18%) derived entirely from oats, with maltose as the main carbohydrate source and an intact beta -glucan content. The oat base was heat treated for 5min at 85 degreesC prior to inoculation. Additives in the form of stabiliser, fat and flavours were used. Texture, syneresis, colour and sensory parameters were evaluated. Yoghurt was used as a control. The final product had an acidity and viscosity similar to those of yoghurt. Addition of xanthan gum (0.03% w/v) improved the texture and overall appearance of the product. The product had the same texture as yoghurt but showed less syneresis. The mixture was less white than the control. The oat-based, yoghurt-like product showed high acceptability in terms of acidity, texture and overall appearance. The addition of flavours resulted in a higher acceptance of the final products by the panellists. The beta -glucan content was still high after the fermentation process. The results indicated the potential for a new, fermentable, oat-based product with high acceptance and a high final beta -glucan content.

"The meat quality of 8-9-month-old cryptorchid, wether and ewe lambs (Poll Dorset x Border Leicester x Merino) was assessed. These lambs were grazed over summer and autumn from weaning (November) on lucerne (Medicago sativa) or ryegrass/clover (Lolium rigidum/trifolium subterranean) pasture at two locations (A or B). After 72 days lambs grazed on lucerne were supplemented with either ad lib clover hay or clover silage. Those grazed on the ryegrass/clover pasture were supplemented from weaning with either oat grain (400-600 g/h day and clover hay ad lib) or oat grain (200-400 g/h day) plus sunflower seed meal (200 g/h day) and clover hay ad lib. Lambs were slaughtered in April and May after they reached 48 kg liveweight. Lambs supplemented solely with roughage produced muscle (m. longissimus thoracis et lumborum; LTL) with a higher (P<0.05) pH, but there was no effect of nutrition or sex on meat colour or tenderness. Slaughter day affected tenderness of the topside (m. semimembranosus). Assessment of aroma, flavour and acceptability was undertaken on the m. biceps femoris from wether and cryptorchid lambs using an experienced taste panel. There was no clear effect of sex or nutrition on the assessment of the sensory attributes. However, panellists considered meat from cryptorchid lambs fed the oats/sunflower supplement and grazed at location B, to have a stronger aroma and flavour (P<0.05) and in some cases to be less acceptable than meat from other combinations of sex, diet and location. The most acceptable meat came from lambs supplemented with oats, irrespective of sex or location. As such, these effects could not be attributed solely to either the diet or sex, but suggest there are conditions where meat from cryptorchids can be less acceptable. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Six Holstein cows fitted with ruminal cannulae were used in two simultaneous 3 x 3 Latin squares to study the effects of protein supplements on ruminal fermentation and in situ crude protein degradability. Cows rotationally grazed a winter oats (Avena sativa L.) pasture and were supplemented with one of three concentrate supplements: 1) low protein sunflower meal (L-SM); 2) high protein sunflower meal (H-SM); or 3) high protein feather meal (H-FM). Concentrates (6.5 kg/d) were offered in equal portions twice daily during milking. Ruminal pH and total volatile fatty acids concentration were unaffected by treatments. Supplementation with L-SM and H-FM decreased ruminal NH3-N concentration compared with H-SM. The concentrate with feather meal had lower effective rumen degradability of crude protein than concentrates containing sunflower meal. Effective rumen degradability of crude protein of pasture averaged 82.7%. Thirty-six multiparous Holstein cows (71 d in milk) were used in a complementary experiment to study the effect of treatments on intake, milk yield, and milk composition. Pasture (13.2 kg/d) and total (19.6 kg/d) dry matter intake (estimated using Cr2O3 as fecal marker) and milk yield (20.5 kg/d) were unaffected by level or source of protein supplemented. Intake of rumen undegradable protein in grazing dairy cows was higher when the amount of sunflower meal was increased or when feather meal was used in the supplement. However, higher rumen undegradable protein intake did not increase milk production, suggesting that rumen undegradable protein was not limiting for cows on pasture producing less than 22 kg of milk.",1086,-1,99,-1,99,0,0,2,1,2,250
"Background: It was recently shown that antiendomysial antibodies (EMAs), which are highly sensitive and specific for celiac disease, are produced by intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, EMAs were detected previously in supernatant fluid from cultured duodenal mucosa specimens collected from untreated celiac disease patients and in culture media of biopsy specimens collected from treated celiac disease patients after an in vitro challenge with gliadin. Moreover, it was recently shown in vivo that oats are not toxic to celiac disease patients suggesting the safety of oats in a gluten free-diet. Objective: The objective was to better define the controversial role of oats in celiac disease to determine whether oats can be safely included in a gluten-free diet. Design: We used an in vitro model to test whether oats induce EMA production in supernatant fluid from cultured duodenal mucosa specimens collected from 13 treated celiac disease patients. The biopsy specimens were cultured with and without peptic-tryptic digest (PT) of gliadin and avenin (from oats) and in medium alone. Samples from 5 of the 13 patients were cultured with the C fraction of PT-avenin. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to detect EMAs. Results: EMAs were detected in specimens from all 13 patients after the challenge with gliadin but not after culture in medium alone. By contrast, no EMAs were detected in any of the specimens cultured with PT-avenin and its C fraction. Conclusions: Because the in vitro challenge with PT-avenin and its C fraction did not induce EMA production in treated celiac disease patients, it appears that oats have no harmful effect on celiac disease. Therefore, oats can be safely included in a gluten-free diet.",1087,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,269
"The conformation of oat globulin dispersions (10% in D2O) under the influence of pH, chaotropic salts, protein structure perturbants, and heating conditions was studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The FTIR spectrum of oat globulin showed major bands from 1670 to 1634 cm(-1), corresponding to the four major types of secondary structures, that is, beta -turns, beta -sheets, alpha -helices, and random coils. At extreme acidic and alkaline pH conditions, there were changes in intensity in the bands attributed to beta -sheet structures (1626, 1634, and 1682 cm(-1)), and shifts of the bands to higher or lower wavenumbers, indicating changes in conformation. In the presence of some chaotropic salts, the 1626 and 1634 cm(-1) bands were shifted upward, with a marked decrease in the intensity of the 1634 cm(-1) peak. The addition of several protein structure perturbants led to a slight shift in the alpha -helix/random coil bands and a marked reduction in the B-sheet peaks, suggesting protein unfolding. Heating under aggregating conditions led to slight shifts in all of the major bands and progressive changes in the intensity of the alpha -helix, beta -sheet, and beta -turn peaks, suggesting protein denaturation. This was accompanied by marked increases in intensity of the two intermolecular beta -sheet bands (1682 and 1624-1626 cm(-1)) associated with the formation of aggregated strands. The IR spectra of soluble and insoluble aggregates showed a redistribution of aggregated strands. The IR spectra of soluble and insoluble aggregates showed a redistribution of native and extensively denatured proteins in the two fractions.",1088,99,99,1,0,99,1,0,1,3,254
"Peroxygenase is a plant enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of a double bond to an epoxide in a stereospecific and enantiofacially selective manner. A microsomal fraction containing peroxygenase was prepared from oat (Avena sativa) seeds and the enzyme immobilized onto a hydrophobic membrane. The enzymatic activity of the immobilized preparation was assayed in 1 h by measuring epoxidation of sodium oleate (5 mg) in buffer-surfactant mixtures. The pH optimum of the reaction was 7.5 when t-butyl hydroperoxide was the oxidant and 5.5 when hydrogen peroxide was the oxidant. With t-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant the immobilized enzyme showed increasing activity to 65 degreesC. The temperature profile with hydrogen peroxide was flatter, although activity was also retained to 65 degreesC. In 1 h reactions at 25 degreesC at their respective optimal pH values, t-butyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide promoted epoxide formation at the same rate. larger-scale reactions were conducted using a 20-fold increase in sodium oleate (to 100 mg). Reaction time was lengthened to 24 h. At optimized levels of t-butyl hydroperoxide 80% conversion to epoxide was achieved. With hydrogen peroxide only a 33% yield of epoxide was obtained, which indicates that hydrogen peroxide may deactivate peroxygenase.",1089,0,0,1,1,99,2,0,2,1,195
"Four donkeys and four ponies were fed molassed dehydrated alfalfa or oat straw, either ad libitum or restricted to about 70% ad libitum intake in a Latin-square design for four periods of 21 d. Measurements of apparent digestibility and gastrointestinal transit time were made on the last 7 d of each period. When the forages were provided ad libitum, all animals ate significantly (P < 0.01) more of the alfalfa than of the oat straw. Ponies consumed significantly (P = 0.007) more of both diets per unit live weight than donkeys. Higher apparent digestibilities of dietary DM, energy and fibre fractions were seen in donkeys, at both levels of feeding, compared with the ponies. This partly compensated for the lower intakes by the donkeys when fed ad libitum. When intake of alfalfa was restricted, the apparent digestibility of DM was higher compared with the corresponding values when fed ad libitum, but the reverse was true for straw. This may be because restriction of a low-quality diet reduced selection of the more digestible parts of the forage. Donkeys and ponies consumed more energy and protein than required when fed alfalfa ad libitum. Both oat straw treatments provided insufficient protein to meet the predicted requirements of ponies and donkeys. Straw intakes ad libitum exceeded the estimated energy requirement for ponies by 34-51%, but donkey energy requirements were only just met. When the amount of straw offered was restricted, 78-90% of the estimated energy requirement for donkeys was met compared with 90-105% for the ponies.",1090,-1,-1,-1,99,-1,0,4,0,1,252
"Lipids, especially polar lipids, can improve loaf volume, grain and texture, anti delay staling in bread. Oats (Avena sativa L.) are rich in total and polar lipids. We have investigated the effect of oat lipids in a bread formulation on loaf volume, appearance, and bread staling. Oat oil was fractionated into polar and nonpolar fractions by water-degumming. Crude oat oil and shortening (at 3%) increased loaf volume by approximate to 11% over the zero lipid formulation. The polar lipid fraction increased loaf volume by nearly the same amount when added at only a 0.5% level. The addition of 3% crude oat oil or 0.7% oat oil polar fraction significantly delayed bread firming and starch retrogradation; the difference between oat lipids and shortening was more evident at the end of a four-day storage period. Oat lipids had a stronger relative effect on bread from a weak flour (10% protein) than from a strong flour (14% protein). The effects of oat oil in the bread formulation could be related to the amphipathic character of polar lipids in oats that enables them to interact with starch, proteins, and other bread components.",1091,99,99,1,99,1,2,0,0,3,188

"Eight Scandinavian oat cultivars were studied as grains, greats before and after kiln drying, rolled oats, and oatmeal for 62 physical, chemical, and sensory parameters over three consecutive crop years. The objectives were to study cultivar and year differences, and the relationships between parameters to find out the cultivars most suitable for rolled oats production and to understand how grain parameters are reflected on great, rolled oat, and oatmeal characteristics. The cultivars and crop years differed (P < 0.05) in most of the parameters. In addition, many great, relied oats, and oatmeal variables showed a significant year by crop interaction. Several grain variables were significantly interrelated but only two, moisture and amount of dark and damaged grains, had a strong correlation (r > 0.70) to rolled oat parameters, the former correlating negatively to crude fat and the latter positively with maximum viscosity value, However, some weaker (r < 0.70) negative associations were found such as those between kernel size value and <beta>-glucan content and water binding capacity of rolled oats. In general, the variables analyzed at different processing stages correlated strongly, indicating good retention of great properties during processing. Various associations were found between the physicochemical parameters of rolled oats and sensory properties of oatmeal. In principal component analysis, factor 1 mostly represented rolled oat parameters such as crude fat, color values L and a, and oatmeal parameters such as toasted aromatics, coarseness, and size of swollen particles. Factor 2 represented properties that pertain to structure and water and rolled oats interactions. The cultivars were also grouped according to these properties. The results suggest that the rolled oat process deserves optimization on a cultivar basis, particularly when specific product properties such as good water binding capacity are required.",1093,99,99,0,1,99,1,0,1,3,288
"Samples of an Australian oat cultivar, Echidna, were pilot-scale processed. At each stage of the processing (raw oats, greats, kiln dried dehulled oats (KDHO), and rolled (flaked)) samples were removed for later sensory and GC-MS analysis of the, flavor components. Mean taste panel scores from a trained taste panel were calculated according to attributes (cereal, burnt, toasted, floury, and yeasty). Attributes were generally similar for both KDHO and flaked oats except in the yeasty attributes. Panelists were able to differentiate between greats, KDHO, and flaked oats(raw oats were not included). The largest effects of heat processing were found for the attributes toasted and yeasty aroma; toasted, cereal, and yeasty flavor; and toasted and yeasty aftertaste. A multi-organoleptic sensor analyzer was able to differentiate all samples when the output was subjected to discriminant function analysis. A reintroduced sample was recognized with a confidence level better than 96%. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) of headspace followed by GC-MS was used to identify volatiles after either dry or slurry heating. Several SPME fiber types were evaluated as to their ability to sorb oat volatiles. A 100-mum poly(dimethylsiloxane) SPME fiber was found to provide the best adsorption profile as measured by number of compounds sorbed and peak area response.

"Hypertension, dyslipidemia and overweight contribute substantially to cardiovascular disease risk. One of the most effective methods for improving high blood pressure and lipid profiles is loss of excess weight. Other recommendations for reducing cardiovascular risk include changes in dietary micronutrient, macronutrient and fiber intakes. To better define a diet for reduction in cardiovascular risk, 43 adults (body mass index 26.4 +/- 3.3, range 20.5-33.9 kg/m(2)) participated in an 8-wk study to determine the effects of two diets on weight, blood pressure, lipids and insulin sensitivity. For 2 wk, weight was maintained and all subjects consumed a control diet. For the next 6 wk, subjects consumed one of two hypocaloric diets (maintenance energy minus 4.2 MJ/d): the control diet (n = 21) or a diet containing oats [45 g/(4.2 MJ dietary energy . d), n = 22]. There was no significant difference between groups in changes in weight loss (control -4.0 +/- 1.1 kg, oats -3.9 +/- 1.6 kg, P = 0.8). The oats diet resulted in greater decreases in mean systolic blood pressure (oats -6 +/- 7 mm Hg, control -1 +/- 10 mm Hg, P = 0.026), whereas diastolic blood pressure change did not differ between the two groups (oats -4 C 6 mm Hg, control -3 +/- 5 mm Hg, P = 0.8).

"Two polar lipid classes, both with three acyl groups, were isolated from an extract of oats and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electrospray mass spectrometry (MS), and electron ionization MS (EIMS). Distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) and the two-dimensional correlation experiments H-1-detected heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectroscopy, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectroscopy, double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy, and total correlation spectroscopy provided sufficient information for determination of the structure of the two lipid classes. The polar lipid classes were found to be N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine [1,2-diacyl-snglycero-3-phospho-(N-acyl)-1'-ethanolamine; N-acyl-PE] and acylphosphatidylglycerol [1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(3'-acyl)-1'-sn-glycerol]. High-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization MS (HPLC-ESMS) and with electrospray ionization tandem MS (HPLC-MS/MS) were utilized for the separation and subsequent determination of molecular species. With HPLC-ESMS, ions of deprotonated molecules were obtained and with HPLC-MS/MS carboxylate ions (representing acyl groups) were obtained as well as other structurally significant ions. Fifty molecular species of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine and 24 molecular species of acylphosphatidylglycerol were found, with a molecular mass range of 924-1032 Da and 959-1035 Da, respectively.

"Cereals in general, and particularly oatmeals, are considered rather sensitive to oxidation owing to their relatively high fat content. The addition of antioxidants can sometimes prolong the shelf-life of products. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the rate of lipid oxidation of a packaged oatmeal product was affected by the nature and level of antioxidants incorporated in an LDPE film structure. The stability of the product, which was determined by hexanal analysis using GC-2MS and by electronic nose analysis, showed very small variations over the chosen storage period. No oxidation, as determined by hexanal levels in the oatmeal, was initiated during storage, but small variations in volatile profile were seen among the samples analysed by the electronic nose. The product stored in the BHT-impregnated LDPE film had undergone the least change during 10 weeks of storage at 20 degreesC. alpha -Tocopherol-impregnated LDPE film did not appear to prolong the shelf-life of the oatmeal at all.

"Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are not usually applied to oat (Avena sativa L) crops. This study was designed to test whether the antigibberellin chlormequat chloride (CCC) and ethylene-releasing ethephon sprayed on to oat foliage represent potential agents for manipulation of yield formation under northern growing conditions. Effects of these PGRs on yield components and tiller growth and productivity were examined in detail. This study included a long-strawed landrace, a modern standard height cultivar, two naked (A. sativa ssp. nuda L.) and two dwarf oats. Field experiments were conducted at Viikki Experimental Farm, University of Helsinki, in 1995 and 1996. Chlormequat chloride was sprayed at the two-node stage and ethephon when the flag leaf ligule was just visible on the main shoot. Various traits characterizing growth and yield formation were assessed. Chlormequat chloride increased grain yield by 0% to 13% depending on cultivar and year, while ethephon most often decreased it by up to 17%. No lodging occurred and the recorded increase in grain yield of CCC treated plants was not therefore due to prevention of lodging. However, CCC treatment resulted in more panicles per square meter and in 1995 tillers contributed more to grain yield. Ethephon treated plants had less grains per main shoot panicle, lower panicle filling rate (PFR) and parallel decreased harvest index (HI). Stem elongation of dwarf oat was enhanced by CCC, in contrast to that of conventional and naked cultivars.",1099,1,1,99,99,99,2,0,0,3,234
"The caryopsis of naked oat is sensitive to mechanical damage at harvest, especially at high grain moisture content. For producing high quality naked oat seed, it is recommended that harvesting be carried out at as low grain moisture content as possible. This reduces mechanical damage to the grain and promotes germination. Under northern growing conditions, grains: are often harvested at 20% moisture content or higher. In this study, reduced grain resulted from using gentler settings on the combine harvester. Two naked oat cultivars and one conventional oat were harvested at different grain moisture content using three combine harvester settings: the first setting that recommended for conventional oat, the second a reduced cylinder speed and the third a narrow concave clearance. The greater the grain moisture content of naked oat at harvest, the more damage was caused by threshing. Lower cylinder speeds tended to result in better germination than higher speeds, even under moist conditions. Narrowing the concave clearance did not affect germination.",1100,99,0,99,99,99,0,0,1,4,162

Harvest index HI) of barley and oat was set to 50%, and straw yields and whole crop cereal silage (WCCS) yields were generated from grain yields accordingly. The MEY in the third year of perennial grass (81.4 GJ/ ha) was significantly lower than that in the first (90.0 GJ/ha) and second years (90.7 GJ/ha). However, on average, the one to three year old perennial grass swards had significantly higher MEY than the annual grass swards (87.7 vs. 83.3 GJ/ha, respectively). The MEYs of perennial and annual grass swards were substantially higher than the MEY of barley grain (52.7 GJ/ha) and oat grain (47.8 GJ/ ha). When the total herbage of cereals, i.e. straw and grain, was used in the calculations, at a ME value of 6.0 MJ/ kg dry matter (DM) for straw, the MEY of barley rose to 75.8 GJ/ha and that of oat to 72.6 GJ/ha. Additionally, the MEY of barley was estimated in the WCCS production situation by converting total herbage to MEY by using ME value 9.9 MJ/kg DM. The MEY of barley in the WCCS calculations was 77.4 GJ/ha, which was significantly lower than the MEY of annual and perennial grass swards.

"During oat seed germination, the insoluble storage proteins must be solubilized and transported to the embryo for use by the developing plantlet. We showed earlier that pH 6.2 active serine and metalloproteinases were the predominant gelatin-hydrolyzing enzymes of oats, while the oat globulins were degraded by pH 3.8 active cysteine proteases. The pH of the endosperms of germinating oats is 6.2. We have continued our characterization of the germinated oat proteinases by determining which hydrolyze avenins, the oat storage prolamins. Avenins of resting seeds were purified and hydrolyzed with proteinases that were extracted from oat seeds that were germinated for various periods. The peptides released were analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The alpha -avenins were hydrolyzed at pH 3.8 by cysteine proteinases from four-day germinated seeds and the beta -avenins were hydrolyzed by similar enzymes from eight-day germinated seeds. At pH 6.2 or pH 5.0, the avenins were not degraded by any of the germinated oats endoproteinases. It is probable that some kind of pH compartmentalization occurs within germinating oat seed. After four days of germination, either new proteinases form or some preexisting proteinases are activated. The cysteine proteinases are apparently responsible for the majority of the storage protein hydrolysis that occurs during oat germination.",1102,0,99,1,0,99,1,0,2,2,203

These treatments removed <1 to 15% of the weight. The material obtained from short pearling times was mostly bran. Longer pearling times increased the amount of starchy endosperm in the pearlings. Antioxidant activity of 80% ethanol extracts, measured by <beta>-carotene bleaching and by reduction of the free radical, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, was highest in the short-pearling-time fractions and decreased as more endosperm tissue was included. Likewise, there was a decreasing concentration of total phenolics, determined colorimetrically, and of several simple phenolic acids, determined by high performance liquid chromatography, as more material was pearled from the greats.-In contrast, concentrations of avenanthramides were not correlated with pearling time, indicating that they were more uniformly distributed in the greats.

The effects of growing location and cultivar were determined in samples replicated over three growing years (1995, 1996, and 1997). Reference analysis by gas chromatography (GC) was effective in developing calibration. High R-2 values were found for great oil (0.98) and oleic (0.98), palmitic (0.95), linoleic (0.95), and methyl stearic (0.90) acids. Corresponding low standard error of calibration (SEC) and standard error of cross-validation were achieved. SEC for oil, palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), and linolenic (18:3) acids were 0.18, 0.04, 0.08, 0.09, and 0.01, respectively. All samples had two corresponding data sets (reference and NIRS estimates). Oleic acid content explained 96% of the variability in great oil content. Cultivar was the single factor influencing oil and fatty acid variability. No growing-location effect was seen. Analysis of variance showed that NIRS and GC methods provided nearly identical rankings of cultivars. Increases in great oil percent showed an increase in oleic acid content and a corresponding decline in linoleic acid. Cvs. SD92125 (now Riser). Hazel, and Don yielded the highest oil constituents, whereas cvs. Troy, Settler, and Jerry consistently yielded the lowest values for the three years.",1106,99,1,1,99,99,2,0,0,3,219
"A protein-rich fraction from oat was found to protect linoleic acid against oxidation in an aqueous suspension containing soybean lipoxygenase-l and micellar linoleic acid. In this system the oat. fraction reduced the initial oxidation rate of linoleic acid by 50% when the oat fraction/linoleic acid ratio was 5:1 (w/w). The oat fraction did not act on the lipoxygenase enzyme but reduced the concentration of linoleic acid that serves as a substrate for lipoxygenase-l. To achieve the reduction in the oxidation rate a contact between liaoleic acid and the oat fraction was required. The efficiency of the protection was dependent on the duration of this contact: the maximum protection was reached after a 5-min incubation period. However, total cessation of oxidation was not; reached with any concentration of the oat fraction, indicating that the oxidizible and non-oxidizible forms of linoleic acid are in equilibrium. Because lipoxygenase-1 prefers the monomeric form of the substrate, the present findings agree with the hypothesis that the oat fraction reduces the concentration of monomolecular form of substrate. In most food systems monomolecular free linoleic acid is liberated slowly and at relatively low concentrations, therefore, even a small amount of the oat fraction would guard the system from oxidative deterioration.",1107,99,-1,1,-1,1,2,2,0,1,203
"The main purpose of this study was to quantify the absorption of nutrients derived from carbohydrate assimilation in a model experiment with catheterised pigs. A low-fibre (LF) diet based on wheat flour and two high-fibre diets with added insoluble fibre from wheat bran (HFWB) or soluble fibre from oat bran (HFOB) were used. The diets were offered as baked rolls to three catheterised pigs in a 3x3 Latin square design. The pigs were surgically fitted with catheters placed in the portal vein and mesenteric artery and with an ultrasonic flow probe attached to the portal vein to monitor the blood-flow rate. The pigs were fed the diets three times daily and portal and arterial blood samples collected twice weekly up to 8 h after the morning feeding. Glucose, insulin, lactic acid (LA) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were determined on the samples. The baseline level of glucose in the portal vein was about 6 mmol/l increasing to 10-11 mmol/l 20-30 min post-feeding with no difference among the different diets. Portal and arterial insulin mirrored portal glucose concentration and was also unaffected by the dietary composition. The net absorption of glucose (per 24 h) was: diet LF 4190 mmol; diet HFWB 3050 mmol and diet HFOB 3190 mmol corresponding to a recovery of 0.76-0.92 of ingested starch. The levels of LA and SCFA in the portal vein were relatively constant in the postprandial period. The net absorption of LA and SCFA was in the same order (749 and 720 mmol/d respectively) with diet LF, while LA was lower (384 and 582 mmol/d) and SCFA higher (738 to 891 mmol/d) when feeding the two high-fibre diets. There was a higher molar proportion of butyrate in the portal vein after feeding the high-fibre diet supplemented with oat bran as compared with the wheat-based diets.",1108,99,0,1,99,1,2,0,1,2,301
"The effect of processing variables; including screw speed (200, 300, and 400 rpm), moisture content (18, 19.5, and 21%), and four different percentages (55, 70,85, and 100% of oat hour an the extrudate physical properties (expansion, bulk density, and texture profiles) and sensory properties were studied; Increasing the percentage of oat flour resulted in extrudates with a lower specific length, higher bulk density, lower lightness, higher redness, lower yellowness, higher hardness, and lower springiness, gumminess, and chewiness. Higher moisture content reduced expansion, except for the 100% oat flour puffs. Screw speed had no significant effect on the bulk density, specific length, and expansion ratio. Principal Component Analysis showed that decreasing moisture content and increasing screw speed resulted in increased product temperature, which was highly correlated with attributes of a more expanded product such as lightness, crispness,shininess, and an open cell structure. With a higher screw speed and a higher product temperature, corn-related flavors were more likely to develop. High correlations between physical and sensory properties were observed.",1109,99,99,0,-1,0,0,1,2,2,167
"The solubility of mineral elements from oat bran and flake samples was studied by a method using equilibrium dialysis after enzymatic digestion of starch and proteins. The effects of six potential chelating agents common in food were tested on the solubility of mineral elements. The minerals studied were calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, zinc and potassium, and the chelating agents were citric, lactic, malic, and ascorbic acids, glucose and xylitol. The mineral elements were tightly bound to the dietary fiber of the samples. Bran fiber bound even the zinc and calcium contributed through the enzymes used. Adding citric, malic, or lactic acids increased the solubility of the mineral elements studied, except for potassium which was easily dialyzable as such. Iron was insoluble in all situations. Citric acid was the most efficient chelating agent in solubilizing the mineral elements. The effect of malic and lactic acids on the solubility of minerals was small. No effect was found with glucose, ascorbic acid, and xylitol. Thus, the intestinal availability of mineral elements may be affected by dietary hydroxy acids such as citric and malic acids in high dietary fiber diets.",1110,0,99,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,186
"During the germination of oats, the major seed storage proteins (globulins) are hydrolyzed by endoproteinases. We have used two methods to characterize these endoproteinases. A qualitative PAGE method that used oat globulins as gel-incorporated substrates was used to determine which enzymes hydrolyzed the globulins. The proteolytic hydrolysis products were studied by hydrolyzing the globulins in vitro with the endoproteinases and analyzing the products by SDS-PAGE. Class-specific proteinase inhibitors were used to show that the globulin hydrolyzing enzymes were cysteine-class proteinases. The proteinases were active at pH 3.8. Using the gel analysis method, a little activity was present at the beginning of seed germination, but the major activity only appeared on the sixth day of germination. Extracts from four-day germinated oats contained cysteine proteinases that hydrolyzed the globulins in vitro to form a polypeptide of intermediate size (MW approximate to 34,500). Cysteine proteases from an eight-day germinated sample totally hydrolyzed the globulins in <1 hr. Very little hydrolysis occurred at pH 6.2, the pH of germinated oats endosperm tissue. The fact that hydrolysis occurred quickly at pH 3.8 implies that there is probably pH compartmentalization within the endosperm, with some areas of the seed having a low pH value where the globulins can be degraded.",1111,99,99,1,0,1,2,0,1,2,204
"Differences in glycemic responses to various starchy foods are related to differences in the rate of starch digestion and absorption. In this study, the importance of the degree of gelatinization and the product thickness for postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses to rolled oats and barley were studied in healthy subjects (5 men and 5 women). Thick (1.0 mm) rolled oats were made from raw or preheated (roasted or steamed) kernels. In addition, thin (0.5 mm) rolled oats were made from roasted or roasted and steamed (processed under conditions simulating commercial production) oat kernels. Finally, steamed rolled barley kernels (0.5 or 1.0 mm) were prepared. All thin flakes elicited high glucose and insulin responses [glycemic index (GI), 88-118; insulinemic index (II), 84-102], not significantly different from white wheat bread (P > 0.05). In contrast, all varieties of thick oat flakes gave significantly lower metabolic responses (GI, 70-78; II, 58-77) than the reference bread (P < 0.05). Thick barley flakes, however, gave high glucose and insulin responses (GI, 94; II, 84), probably because the botanical structure underwent move destruction than the corresponding oat flakes. We conclude that minimal processing of oat and barley flakes had a relatively minor effect on GI features compared with the more extensive commercial processing. One exception was thick oat flakes, which in contrast to the corresponding barley flakes, had a low GI.",1112,1,-1,0,0,1,2,1,2,0,225
"Three batches of oats were extruded under four combinations of process temperature (150 or 180 degrees C) and process moisture (14.5 and 18%). Two of the extrudates were evaluated by a sensory panel, and three were analyzed by GC-MS. Maillard reaction products, such as pyrazines, pyrroles, furans, and sulfur-containing compounds, were found in the most severely processed extrudates (high-temperature, low-moisture). These extrudates were also described by the assessors as having toasted cereal attributes. Lipid degradation products, such as alkanals, 2-alkenals, and 2,4-alkadienals, were found at much higher levels in the extrudates of the oat flour that had been debranned. It contained lower protein and fiber levels than the others and showed increased lipase activity. Extrudates from these samples also had significantly lower levels of Maillard reaction products that correlated, in the sensory analysis, with terms such as stale oil and oatmeal. Linoleic acid was added to a fourth oat flour to simulate the result of increased lipase activity, and GC-MS analysis showed both an increase in lipid degradation products and a decrease in Maillard reaction products.",1113,99,0,1,99,99,1,0,1,3,176
"The in vitro fermentabilities of rye, wheat and oat brans and of a commercial fibre preparation, inulin, were compared. The brans were first digested enzymatically to remove starch and protein. The digested brans and inulin were then fermented with human faecal inoculum. The progress of fermentation was studied by following the consumption of carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty acids and gases. Inulin, a short fructose polymer, was consumed significantly faster than the more complex carbohydrates of cereal brans. Carbohydrates of oat bran (rich in beta-glucan) were consumed at a higher rate than those of rye and wheat brans (rich in arabinoxylan). In all brans, glucose was consumed faster than the other main sugars, arabinose and xylose, and arabinose was degraded only slightly. The total production of short-chain fatty acids was slightly higher with oat bran than with rye and wheat brans and inulin. In the fermentation of inulin, relatively more butyric acid and less propionic acid were produced than in the fermentation of brans. The decrease in pH was also greater In the case of inulin. Wheat bran led to a slightly slower gas formation than rye and oat brans. Formation of gases was fastest and greatest in the case of inulin. In conclusion, rye, wheat and oat brans were fermented in a rather similar way. Fermentation of the brans was different from that of inulin. Cereal brans might serve as a more balanced source of dietary fibre supplement than gas-producing, readily fermentable polysaccharides such as inulin.

"Specific enzymes were used to decompose protein and beta-glucans in wholemeal oats prior to measuring pasting and thermal properties of the meal using rapid viscoanalysis and differential scanning calorimetry. beta-Glucans were responsible for a large proportion of these properties of the meals, while the contribution of protein was much less.

Molecular weight (M) of the beta-glucans used was determined using high-performance size exclusion chromatography equipped with a triple detector system of right angle light scattering, viscometry and refractive index.

"The in vitro bile acid binding by rice, oat, wheat, and corn brans was determined using a mixture of bile acids normally secreted in human bile at a physiological pH of 6.3. The objective of the study was to relate bile acid binding of cereal brans to health promoting properties. Three experiments were conducted testing substrates on an equal weight (dry matter) basis, an equal total dietary fiber (TDF) basis, and an equal TDF and equal fat basis. Each experiment was repeated to validate the results (for a total of six experiments). The relative in vitro bile acid binding of the cereal brans on an equal TDF basis considering cholestyramine as 100% bound was rice bran 51%, wheat bran 31%, oat bran 26% and corn bran 5%. The data suggest that cholesterol lowering by rice bran appears to be related to bile acid binding. The primary mechanism of cholesterol lowering by oat bran may not be due to bile acid binding by soluble fiber. Bile acid binding did not appear to be proportional to the soluble fiber content of the cereal brans tested. Bile acid binding by wheat bran may contribute to cancer prevention and other healthful properties.",1117,1,1,1,1,-1,4,1,0,0,198
"Oats contain a range of functional ingredients; these are concentrated to a greater or lesser extent in different parts of the kernel. Dry milling of oats using roller milling offers the opportunity to produce, at a lower processing cost, fractions enriched in antioxidant activity. Oats were roller milled and the stocks separated by size using sieving; the fractions were analysed for compositional differences. A clear difference was seen between the larger particles, which were richer in bran and its associated components. and the smaller, starch-rich particles: with a natural cut-off point occuring at 420 mu m. This established the feasibility of using dry milling and sieving oats to yield enriched fractions. Oats (cv. Gerald) from a variety of sources were dehulled then milled once and fractionated to yield a bran-rich fraction (>420 mu m) and a starch-rich fraction (<420 mu m). Polar lipid extracts were derived from these fractions and their antioxidant activity measured by chemiluminescence (CL). Bran-rich fractions had significantly higher antioxidant activity than the corresponding starch-rich fraction and appealed to have a more potent population of phenolic antioxidant compounds.

"Cell wall materials from various cellular tissues of cereals may potentially influence the digestion and absorption processes in different ways. The objective of the present investigation was to study the breakdown of plant carbohydrates in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs fed a low-fibre (LF; 65g kg(-1) dry matter) wheat flour-based diet and two high-fibre diets with added insoluble fibre from wheat bran (HFWB; 112g kg(-1) dry matter) or soluble fibre from oat bran (HFOB; 108g kg(-1) dry matter). The diets were formulated to provide similar to 0.31 energy from fat, similar to 0.18 energy from protein and similar to 0.51 energy from carbohydrates and were offered as baked rolls to eight ileum-cannulated hypercholesterolemic pigs in a crossover design. Carbohydrates were the predominant heal constituent, with most of the carbohydrates present as non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). Starch in all diets was almost completely digested at this site of the gastrointestinal tract, with digestibility values above 0.99. The ingested amount of NSP was quantitatively recovered in ileal materials with the wheat-based diets, while there was a significant loss of 0.27 of NSP primarily as mixed linked (1-->3) (1-->4)-beta-D-glucan with diet HFOB. The concentration and flow of lactic acid were also highest in the ileum after feeding diet HFOB, indicating that beta-glucan stimulated lactic acid formation. Any soluble components that reached the large intestine were almost completely broken down, while the digestibility of insoluble NSP constituents was significantly lower for diets LF and HFWB than for diet HFOB, The high degradation of oat bran resulted in a lower effect on faecal dry and wet bulking than was found with wheat bran. In conclusion, cereal starch was practically completely degraded in the small intestine, while the site and extent of NSP degradation, lactic acid formation and bullring properties were influenced by the fibre source.

"One hundred-eighty hypercholesterolemic subjects following the National Cholesterol Education Program Step One Diet were randomly divided into six groups (30 +/- 2/group). Group 1 served as the control and received no fiber supplements. The fiber supplemented groups received 50 g/day of oat bran or amaranth from various sources: Group 2 (oat bran muffins); Group 3 (amaranth muffins); Group 4 (Oat Bran O's); Group 5 (Oat Bran Flakes); and Group 6 (a variety of oat bran products). Pasting serum total cholesterol (FSTC), low density-, very low density-, and high density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, VLDL-C, and HDL-C) and serum triacylglycerols were measured before and after the 28-day intervention. Three-day diet records were completed before and after intervention. Subjects reduced (P < 0.05) the mean intake of total and saturated fat, and cholesterol, FSTC dropped more than twice as much (P < 0.05) as was observed with fat modification alone (Group 1 = -0.31 mmol/L), when oat bran was provided as flakes (Group 5 = -0.86 mmol/L) or in a variety of forms (Group 6 = -0.75 mmol/L). If the initial ratio of HDL-C to FSTC was low, then supplementation did not decrease FSTC to the extent observed when the initial ratio was high. Compliance with the dietary interventions was best when the subjects gave the product a rating of less than or equal to 2.0 (on a 1-4 hedonic scale, with 1 being excellent). We can conclude from these data that fiber supplementation to reduce serum cholesterol is most effective in hypercholesterolemic individuals that have a greater proportion of HDL-C. In addition, not all the oat bran products evaluated were able to lower cholesterol to the same extent, indicating that the ability of soluble fiber to reduce FSTC can be compromised by other dietary factors such as insoluble fiber.",1123,1,1,-1,1,-1,3,2,0,0,296
"Analysis of Raman spectra of oat globulin showed that extreme pH values caused an increase in the amide and C-H stretching band intensity, indicating changes in the secondary structures of the protein due to denaturation. Similar changes were observed when oat globulin was treated with chaotropic salts and several protein perturbants. Sodium dodecyl sulfate, beta-mercaptoethanol, and ethylene glycol also caused a shift in the amide III' band, suggesting a transition from beta-sheet to a random coil conformation. Heating at temperatures near the denaturation temperature of oat globulin led to increases in the amide and C-H band intensity, indicating unfolding of the protein.

"Grain characteristics and great composition have been evaluated in 35 genotypes from nine taxonomic species of Avena, including three species (A. agadiriana, A. atlantica, A. damascena) for which no previous data are available. There was substantial interspecific and intraspecific variation for all characteristics measured. The proportion of groat in the grain ranged from 32.7-62.1 %, and mean groat weight from 2.4-37.4 mg. Groat protein concentrations ranged from 13.9-41.3%, and exceeded 32% in one A. atlantica, two A. damascena and one A. murphyi genotype. Great beta-glucan concentration showed very wide variation (2.2-11.3%) are there were substantial interspecific and intraspecific differences. The highest beta-glucan concentrations were found in genotypes of A. atlantica. Although there were interspecific and intraspecific variations in great oil concentration (4.2-10.6%), and in fatty acid composition, data were within previously reported ranges for A. sativa.

"Six Holstein-Friesian heifers fitted with ruminal, duodenal, and ileal cannulas were used in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square to study the effects of partial replacement [1:1 dry matter (DM) basis] of fresh winter oats (WO) by ground corn (C) or barley (B) on digestion and bacterial protein synthesis. Supplemented diets contained 24% starch, and all diets were fed indoors at 2.5% of body weight (DM basis). Ruminal and total tract digestibilities of organic matter and neutral detergent fiber were similar for all treatments. Ruminal and total tract starch digestibility was similar for C and B diets. Nitrogen intake was greater for WO than for supplemented diets. However, duodenal flows of nonammonia N and bacterial N did not differ among treatments. The efficiency of bacterial protein synthesis was similar for the three diets, suggesting that the fermentation of high quality fresh forage DM provided sufficient energy for the microorganisms in the rumen. Ruminal ammonia-N concentration was greater for WO than for supplemented diets, and for C than for B diet. Ruminal fluid pH and concentrations of total volatile fatty acid were not different among diets, but concentration of acetate was higher and that of propionate was lower for WO than for supplemented diets and for C than for B diet.

"The production of oat bran involves the dehulling of oats, inactivation of their enzymes, and the subsequent grinding and sieving of the clean greats to isolate the larger bran particles. The bran yield from the oat greats may be related to their hardness, as it is in wheat. Great breakage, which occurs during the dehulling process, reduces milling yield and may also be related to great hardness. This study sought to investigate genotypic and environmental effects on oat dry milling and oat dehulling characteristics, and attempted to define properties associated with oat great hardness. Significant genotypic differences in bran yield were largely attributed to great composition, where higher beta-glucan and oil concentrations in the great were associated with higher bran yields. Bran composition was largely dependent on a combination of the bran yield and the great composition. Although great breakage was correlated with bran yield and with great beta-glucan concentration, environmental factors appeared to be more influential, Locations that had suffered severe crown rust infestations exhibited higher rates of great breakage during dehulling. Bran yield was not as strongly affected at the locations infested with crown rust, indicating that bran yield and great breakage are manifestations of different types of groat hardness and are only partially related.",1127,1,1,99,0,99,2,0,1,2,207
"The suitability of the falling number method for oats was studied using samples of oat greats, oat bran, oat endosperm flour, and rolled oats. Sample sizes of 4.5-8 g were tested. The results showed that a standard 7-g sample falling number determination would be suitable for oats, the falling number of samples varying from 328 to 721 sec. Due to high gelatinization temperature of oat starch, falling number values <300 sec showed greater variation than those >300 sec. Oat great samples from two separate kiln drying processes showed that kiln drying increased the falling number values by 30-89%. The falling number determination is a potential tool for estimating the adequacy of kiln drying of oats.

"This experiment evaluated three hypotheses: i) production of propionate is increased during fermentation of substrate containing oat bran (OB)(6); ii) production of butyrate is increased during fermentation of substrate containing wheat bran (WB) and iii) results of in vitro fermentations using physiological substrates and inocula agree with in vivo data. Ileal digesta collected from swine fed OB and WE were the substrates. Digesta was fermented for 0-96 h in an anaerobic in vitro system using inocula prepared from ceca of rats fed the same fiber sources. Carbohydrate and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) contents in the fermentations were measured by gas chromatography. Fermentation of WE digesta did not produce more n-butyrate (P > 0.05) and was significantly slower (P < 0.05) than fermentation of OB digesta. OB digesta fermentation produced a significantly greater (P < 0.05) molar proportion of SCFA as propionate, Bacterial mass increased more and was maintained longer during fermentation of OB digesta than the WE digesta. Our results indicate that dilution of undigested WE fiber and not n-butyrate production is one mechanism by which WE may protect colonic mucosa; propionate production is increased during fermentation of P-glucan in OB; and an in vitro system using physiological sources of inoculum and substrate containing WE and OB yields results that agree with in vivo findings in humans and rats.",1129,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,219
"Oat bran has a high phytate content and a low or inactivated phytase activity. A high intake of oat bran could therefore result in an impaired absorption of trace elements. The effect of a mean daily intake of 142 g of oat bran (102 g/10 MJ) on absorption of zinc was evaluated by the use of stable isotopes and fecal monitoring in 12 healthy subjects (6 males and 6 females). Each subject participated in two separate diet periods each of 21 d with identical low-fiber diets and with oat bran added in one of the periods. The oat bran was incorporated into bread and served at three daily main meals. The intake of zinc and phytate per 10 MJ was 138 mu mol (9.0 mg) and 0.5 mmol, respectively, in the low-fiber period and 225 mu mol (14.7 mg) and 4.0 mmol, respectively, in the oat bran period. Stable isotopes of zinc (Zn-70) were added to the diets at d 7 of each period. The fractional absorptions (means +/- SD) of zinc from the low-fiber and oat bran diets were 0.48 +/- 0.11 and 0.40 +/- 0.15 (P = 0.07), respectively. The higher zinc content in the oat bran period resulted in a greater amount of zinc absorbed (64 +/- 19 mu mol and 99 +/- 51 mu mol, respectively, P = 0.009). Balance data suggest that the higher absorbed amount of zinc resulted in correspondingly higher intestinal endogenous excretion of zinc. In conclusion, the absorption of zinc was high and not affected by addition of oat bran.",1130,-1,-1,1,0,1,2,2,1,0,258
"The dietary fibre fractions in two winter cultivars each of hulled oats and naked oats grown on three sites under different agronomic conditions in two years were studied. Overall, soluble nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) represented some 540 g kg(-1) of total NSP, and this did not vary greatly among cultivars. There was a significant (P < 0.001) positive relationship between total and soluble NSP. Within cultivars there was much greater variability in the concentrations of beta-glucans than in soluble NSP, and overall there was no relationship between the concentrations of the two related fractions. Oat cultivar and factors such as year and site where grown significantly (P < 0.01) affected soluble NSP contents. There were some indications that environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall and sunshine hours may have been responsible for the apparent effects of site and year. On a dehulled basis, traditional hulled cultivars contained significantly (P < 0.05) more beta-glucans than the naked types, and the results suggest that selection of oats for dietary or plant-breeding purposes should be based on beta-glucan rather than soluble NSP concentrations.

"Flavour is of direct importance in the acceptance of oatmeals. Panel tests of an oatmeal sample require well-trained panellists and are expensive, time-consuming and difficult. To investigate an appropriate method of sensory testing to be used in a breeding programme, 12 oat samples were processed in the factory and their sensory qualities were assessed by a trained panel. Sensory quality was related to both variety and growing conditions, with variety being the major controlling factor. The volatile profile of the oatmeals was determined by solid phase microextraction using headspace and gas chromatography. Relatively few volatiles were detected in greats, while more than 50 peaks were detected in oatmeals, indicating that most of the volatiles in oatmeals were induced during heat processing. Volatile compounds detected from oatmeals were correlated with the sensory data, and chromatographic peak areas accounted for 43-94% of the variations in sensory attributes. Preliminary identification of volatile compounds showed that the major compounds included hydrocarbons, alcohols, acids and aldehydes.

"The effects of fat level (5, 12 and 30%), carrageenan and oat fibre on the texture of frankfurters were evaluated using mechanical properties and sensory (taste panel) methods. Textural profile analysis (TPA) indicated that fat reduction decreased hardness, adhesiveness, gumminess and chewiness. In contrast, springiness increased when the fat content was reduced from 30% to 5%. No relationships between fat content and either Warner-Bratzler or Kramer shear parameters were found. Carrageenan and oat fibre differed in their effects on TPA values hut the latter was more effective at improving texture. Taste panellists did not detect any differences in hardness, springiness or gumminess when fat was reduced from 30% to 5%, although increases in cohesiveness, chewiness, moisture release and lumpiness were observed. Overall acceptability of the texture decreased as the fat level was reduced. Carrageenan and oat fibre improved the acceptability elf the 12% fat frankfurters, but neither ingredient offset the detrimental effects on acceptability of the texture when fat was reduced to 5%. The results demonstrate that carrageenan and oat fibre can partially offset some of the textural changes (juiciness, cohesiveness, lumpiness) which occur in low-fat frankfurters when added water replaces fat and the protein level remains constant.",1133,-1,99,1,99,99,1,1,0,3,198
"Flow characteristics and functional properties of water-soluble beta-glucan rich extractions prepared from hulled barley, hulless barley and oats were investigated. Rheological behavior was studied using a coaxial viscometer over shear rates of 3.0-1312 s(-1). The shear rate-shear stress data followed the power law and Herschel-Bulldey models. The flow behaviour index values varied from 0.31-0.97, indicating mildly to highly pseudoplastic nature of the aqueous solutions of beta-glucan rich extractions. The pseudoplasticity for the aqueous solutions increased with increasing concentration of extractions. The hulless barley beta-glucan rich extractions showed higher pseudoplasticity, consistency index, and yield stress values; absorbed less water and exhibited higher fat absorption and oil emulsifying properties than those of the hulled barley and oats. There was no discernible influence of fat contents on functional properties of the concentrates. Dough development time, arrival time, stability and softening of the dough were negligibly affected with addition of various beta-glucan rich extractions to the flours. Supplementation of beta-glucan rich extractions desirably increased the baking absorption of the flours. Bread with improved loaf quality could be obtained using various beta-glucan rich extractions upto a level of 1.00% (w/w), especially, from those of hulless barley cv.

"During the malting of oats, the insoluble seed storage proteins are hydrolysed by endoproteinases. These germinated oat seed endoproteinases are to be characterised. A qualitative 2-D (IEF x PAGE) method using the gel-incorporated substrate gelatin was used to study the heterogeneity of the enzymes and a quantitative 'in solution' assay employing azogelatin was utilised to measure the different proteinase classes present. Proteinase development during malting was monitored at pH 3.8, 6.2 (the pH of the germinated oat endosperm) and 8.0. The numbers and intensities of the proteolylic activities increased during the first three days of germination, but not after that. Electrophoretic studies using class specific endoproteinase inhibitors indicated that the predominant enzymes were serine and metalloproteinases. No aspartic or cysteine proteinases were detected. The 'in solution' analyses gave somewhat different results from those obtained with the 2-D method. The concomitant addition of 10 mM calcium and 8 mM cysteine raised the measured activity by 2.5 fold and, in the presence of these activators, a third of the 'in solution' activity was due to cysteine proteinases, the serine and metalloproteinases each contributed 15% of the activity and the other third of the activity was impervious to all of the inhibitors. These different 2-D and 'in solution' results may simply reflect the fact that the enzymes hydrolyse the substrate differently, depending on whether it is dissolved ('in solution') or in a bound (2-D analysis) form.

"Sensory profiling of cooked oatmeal was carried out for rolled-oat process optimization and product characterization purposes. The main sensory properties of oatmeal (thickness, adherence to spoon, size of swollen flake particles, uniformity of mass, slipperiness, coarseness, darkness of colour) were included in the group of appearance and texture attributes. Odour and flavour were fairly weak, the terms most often used being toasted, sweet, cereal, and chemical. Rolled oats of five various cultivars differed in the oatmeal characteristics such as thickness, adherence to spoon, and size of swollen flake particle. Two commercial rolled-oat brands varying in their flake thickness (0.54 and 0.77 mm) and cooking time (10 and 15 min) resulted in oatmeals with different texture profiles. Two cooking conditions also tested - adding the rolled oats either to cold or boiling water - profoundly influenced the texture characteristics quantified.",1136,1,99,99,99,1,2,0,0,3,139
"Nine strains of lactic acid bacteria were tested for fermentation characteristics in an oat- based, non-dairy milk substitute, Mill Milk(TM) (MM medium). Viable counts, aroma formation, lactic acid production and viscosity were the parameters investigated. In general, bacterial strains grown at 30 degreesC yielded a better flavour and higher viable counts than those incubated at 37 degreesC. Strains were selected for their capacity to produce exopolysaccharides in a semi-defined medium. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCFB 2772 was chosen for further fermentation experiments, using yoghurt as a control. Production of exopolysaccharide and shear thinning properties were measured using a viscosimetric method. A combination of temperature stress and an increased carbon nitrogen ratio was shown to affect the production of exopolysaccharide. Increased viscosity was found after incubation at a low temperature using glucose as a supplementary carbon source. The production of exopolysaccharides was also favoured by prolonged incubation times. The use of physical factors such as time and temperature in combination with chemical factors, i.e. media and carbon nitrogen levels, were crucial in the course of improving exopolysaccharide production during fermentation in the MM medium.",1137,1,99,-1,99,99,1,1,0,3,183
"Milled oat great pearlings, trichomes, flour, and bran were extracted with methanol and the fractions tested in vitro for antioxidant capacity against low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and R-phycoerythrin protein oxidation in the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. The oxidative reactions were generated by 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) HCl (AAPK) or Cu2+ in the LDL assay and by AAPH or Cu2+ + H2O2 in the ORAC assay and calibrated against a Trolox standard to calculate Trolox equivalents (1 Trolox equivalent = 1 TE = activity of 1 mu mol of Trolox). The antioxidant capacity of the oat fractions was generally consistent with a potency rank of pearlings (2.89-8.58 TE/g) > flour (1.00-3.54 TE/g) > trichome (1.74 TE/g) = bran (1.02-1.62 TE/g) in both LDL and ORAC assays regardless of the free radical generator employed. A portion of the oat antioxidant constituents may be heat labile as the greatest activity was found among non-steam-treated pearlings. The contribution of oat tocols from the fractions accounted for <5% of the measured antioxidant capacity. AAPH-initiated oxidation of LDL was inhibited by the oat fractions in a dose-dependent manner, although complete suppression was not achieved with the highest doses tested. In contrast, Cu2+-initiated oxidation of LDL stimulated peroxide formation with low oat concentrations but completely inhibited oxidation with higher doses. Thus, oats possess antioxidant capacity most of which is likely derived from polar phenolic compounds in the aleurone.",1138,99,1,0,1,1,3,0,1,1,230
"Oat milling fractions were examined for concentrations of total phenolics, tocols, and phenolic acids and in vitro antioxidant activity to determine their potential as dietary antioxidants. Methanolic extracts of pearling fractions, flour and aspirations from flaking, and trichomes had high, intermediate, and low antioxidant activities, respectively, evaluated by the beta-carotene bleaching method. Pearling fractions were also highest in total phenolics and tocols, p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC. Three avenanthramides and an unidentified ferulate derivative were also detected. Total phenolic content was significantly correlated with antioxidant activity, and regression equations that predicted antioxidant activity from phenolic and tocol concentrations were calculated. Antioxidant activity, evaluated by beta-carotene bleaching, was correlated with measures of oxygen radical absorbance capacity and low-density lipoprotein oxidation. These data indicate a potential for oat products, especially those enriched in outer layers of the great, to contribute to dietary intakes of antioxidant phytonutrients.",1139,0,99,1,1,0,2,0,2,1,157
"Research was initiated to measure antioxidant activity of extracts from oat (Avena sativa L.) greats and hulls and the concentrations of phenolic substances that may contribute to antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity of ethanolic extracts of four cultivars was evaluated by an in vitro assay that measures the inhibition of coupled autoxidation of linoleic acid and beta-carotene. Total phenolic content was determined using Folin and Ciocalteau's phenol reagent and was expressed as gallic acid equivalents. Phenolic compounds were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and detected at 290 nm. Peaks were identified by comparing retention times and spectra with known standards and verified with internal standards. Greats had significantly higher antioxidant activity than hulls. For two cultivars, total phenolic content was similar in greats and hulls, whereas one cultivar had higher and another lower total phenolic content in greats than hulls. Ten phenolic compounds were separated and identified in extracts, and one flavan-3-ol and three avenanthramides were tentatively identified. The concentrations of many of these compounds differed among cultivars and between fractions. In general, caffeic acid and the avenanthramides were predominantly found in greats, whereas many of the other phenolics were present in greater concentrations in hulls.",1140,1,1,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,194
"Nine chymotrypsin and four trypsin inhibitors have been extracted and separated from ungerminated oat grains. The inhibitors fell into two groups, based on their heat and pH stabilities. Members of the most abundant group are labile and are inactivated at 80 degrees C or at pHs of 3.3 or lower. Members of the second group are stable and are resistant to boiling for 30 min. On germination, the labile inhibitors are inactivated after 2 days and the stable chymotrypsin inhibitors after 3 days. Most of the labile inhibitors from ungerminated grain are destroyed when incubated at 20 degrees C for 20 h but addition of PMSF, a serine protease inhibitor, prevented their inactivation. Labile inhibitors in extracts of ungerminated oats are inactivated on incubation with an extract prepared from germinated oats, but not in the presence of PMSF. Most oat chymotrypsin and trypsin inhibitors are heal labile and pH sensitive. These inhibitors are apparently inactivated by serine proteinase(s) already present in ungerminated grain.

"The aim of this study was to investigate whether consumption of a newly developed oat milk deprived of insoluble fiber would result in lower serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in men with moderate hypercholesterol em ia. The study had a randomized, controlled double-blind design, and oat milk was compared with an identically flavored control drink. Sixty-six men were recruited from a screening program and were randomly assigned to two groups. Each group took either oat milk or a control drink (rice milk) for 5 weeks (0.75 liters/day) and then switched to the other drink regimen for another 5-week period with a 5-week washout period between the test periods. The oat milk contained more dietary fiber, especially P-glucan (0.5 g/100 g), than the control drink (<0.02 g/100 g). Both drinks were well appreciated and got similar sensory evaluation, indicating that the double-blind design had been attained. in the final analysis 52 subjects remained. Compared with the control drink, intake of oat milk resulted in significantly lower serum total cholesterol (6%, p = 0.005) and LDL cholesterol (6%, p = 0.036) levels. The decrease in LDL cholesterol was more pronounced if the starting value was higher (r = -0.55, p < 0.001). The concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not significantly different after consumption of the two drinks. Serum triglycerides did not change significantly after intake of oat milk, but a significant increase was observed after intake of the control drink (p = 0.003). It is concluded that also oat milk deprived of insoluble fiber has cholesterol-reducing properties. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.",1142,-1,1,1,1,0,3,1,1,0,266
"Four-week-old male golden Syrian hamsters were fed diets containing cellulose (control, CC), cellulose + soy protein (CS), CS + vitamin E, (CSE), rice bran (RB), RE + vitamin E (RBE), oat bran (OB), and OB + Vitamin E (OBE) for six weeks (pl = 10/treatment). Diets contained (by weight) 10% total dietary fiber, 3% N, 20% fat, 0.5% cholesterol, and some diets had an additional 0.1% vitamin E, After six weeks, RE and OB diets resulted in significantly higher weight gain than the CC diet. Plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) values and the LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in hamsters fed CSE, RBE, OB, and OBE diets were significantly lower than in those fed CC diet. There were no significant differences in total plasma cholesterol values among the hamsters fed any of the diets. Liver cholesterol in animals fed OB and OBE diets was significantly lower than in all other groups. Foam cell areas in the inner bend of the aortic arch in animals fed all treatment diets were significantly reduced when compared with that in animals fed CC diet. The level of additional dietary vitamin E did not result in further significant reductions in foam cell area.

"The structural differences between oat and barley starches were investigated by analysing starch polymers released from the granules and the granule residues during heating. When the temperature was increased from 85 to 97 degrees C the amount of leached carbohydrates increased from 6.1-8.7% to 36.1-37.4%. Concurrently, the lysophospholipid content of the granule residues decreased from 0.87-1.0% to 0.35-0.46%, indicating that lysophospholipids were also present in the solubilised fraction. Oat and barley starch dispersions preheated to 95 degrees C were further fractionated by sequential centrifugation. After the first centrifugation of both starches, 68-70% of the carbohydrate in the supernatant was amylose. After recentrifugation, an insoluble fraction with a high amylose to lipid ratio was obtained. Oat and barley starches showed similar fractionation behaviour, but the molecular weight of the solubilised oat starch was somewhat higher. (C) 1999 Academic Press.",1144,0,99,0,1,0,1,0,3,1,138
"Lipids in oat grains are protected against oxidation by various chemical compounds with antioxidant properties. Biologically active compounds such as tocopherols, L-ascorbic acid, thiol, phenolic amino acids and phenol compounds feature such properties. Phenolic compounds inhibit lipase activity, protect lipids against oxidation and, as a consequence, protect plant cells against the destructive activity of free radicals. The disadvantage of natural antioxidants is their low resistance to high temperatures since heating over 80C destroys their antioxidant properties. Operation such as drying, blanching, roasting or extrusion destroy the protective system of plant lipids. The paper is an attempt to explain to what degree extrusion conditions influence activity of natural antioxidants. Oaf flour possessing the largest amount of lipids and biologically active compounds compared to other cereal flour was used in the model system. It has been found that oat phenolic compounds are a mixture of free phenolic acids, esters and phenolic acid glycosides as well as flavonols and polyphenols. It has been established that alcoholic extracts produced from oat great and flour had strong antioxidant properties, whereas the extracts front extruded substances did not reveal such properties. During extrusion about 50% degradation of phenolic compounds was observed. Phenolic compounds were the main group of organic compounds enabling enzyme activity and playing an antioxidant role.",1145,-1,1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,212

"Effects of short-term storage on pasting properties of whole, ground and processed greats of three oat varieties, Mortlock, Cooba and Yarran, were studied using a Rapid Viscoanalyser. Characteristics of whole greats changed little with storage, whereas those of ground greats changed substantially, dependent on variety, storage temperature and time. Final Viscosity was the most sensitive parameter. These changes call into question collaborative studies involving transport or storage of ground samples. Processing of oats caused increases in Peak and Final Viscosity characteristic of cultivar. Differential Scanning Calorimetry thermograms suggested that Yarran contained up to three populations of starch granules which differ in gelatinisation properties. Short term storage of processed oats had no significant effect on pasting properties. Viscograms of lipid-extracted meals changed little during storage, but storage of reconstituted meals affected Time To Peak Viscosity, Breakdown, Final Viscosity and Setback. Slow interactions between lipid and starch were the main factors in changing pasting properties, whereas oxidative rancidity had little effect.",1148,99,0,99,99,99,0,0,1,4,159

"Six oat genotypes were grown in nursery yield trials during 1989-1992 at Lisbon, ND. Greats were analyzed for soluble and insoluble dietary fiber content and composition. Genotype-by-growing year interaction was not significant for soluble or insoluble dietary fiber. Soluble and insoluble dietary fiber differed with genotype (6.0-7.1% and 4.1-4.9%, respectively) and with growing year (6.0-6.9% and 3.9-5.2%, respectively). The genotype-by-growing year interaction was significant for soluble beta-glucan content but not for total neutral sugar or uronic acid content of the soluble dietary fiber. Genotypes did vary in total neutral sugar content but not in uronic acid content.

Genotypes did vary in total neutral sugar, beta-glucan, and Klason lignin content but not in uronic acid content of insoluble dietary fiber. The neutral sugar content of soluble dietary fiber was composed of glucose, arabinose, xylose, and galactose. The neutral sugar content of insoluble fiber was composed of glucose, arabinose, and xylose. The content and composition of soluble and insoluble dietary fiber varied with oat genotype.

"Effects of cooking temperature (70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 degrees C) and stirring speed (60, 160, 260 rpm) on the gel/paste properties of cornstarch and oat flour were investigated. Pasting properties during cooking were evaluated using an Rapid Visco-Analyser-4 (RVA). Rheological properties and microstructure of cooled gels/pastes were evaluated using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and stress relaxation and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For both cornstarch and oat flour, the storage modulus (G') of gels measured at 25 degrees C increased with cooking temperature up to about 85 degrees C at 160 rpm and 260 rpm and up to about 90 degrees C at 60 rpm and decreased dramatically thereafter for all stirring speeds. G' values for oat flour gels were lower than those for cornstarch gels at all temperatures, but particularly at 85 degrees C and 90 degrees C. Higher G' values of the cornstarch gels at these temperatures were associated with a composite gel structure containing collapsed starch granules. This phenomenon was not as apparent for the oat flour gels. The scanning electron micrographs of cornstarch and oat flour gels prepared at the different cook temperatures highlighted the importance of changes in the starch granules on both the pasting curves and rheological properties of the corresponding gels. Results for stress relaxation indicated that the cornstarch gels were more solidlike for all RVA cook temperatures.

"Peroxygenase is an enzyme of higher plants that is capable of using hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide for oxidation of a double bond to an epoxide. A microsomal fraction was prepared from dry oat (Avena sativa) seeds. The peroxygenase activity of this fraction was tested using fatty acid hydroperoxide 2a [13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z), 11(E)-octadecadienoic acid] and its methyl ester 2b as sources of peroxygen. These were prepared by the action of soybean lipoxygenase on linoleic acid. A high-performance liquid chromatographic assay was used to differentiate between peroxygen cleavage and peroxygen cleavage with accompanying double-bond oxidation. Higher activity was obtained with 2b compared to 2a, and peroxygen cleavage activity was observed in both aqueous and organic solvent media.

"The effect of amaranth and oat bran on the lipids of blood and liver in rats depending on the kind of fats in diet was the subject of our study. Sixty male Buffalo rats were fed for 28 days one of six diet containing 15% of fat (lard or sunflower oil), 20% of protein and 0.5% of cholesterol. Amaranth and oat bran added to diet provided 4-4.5% of dietary fiber, water soluble fraction of which amounted to 30%. Amaranth significantly decreased the level of total cholesterol in rats blood serum (by 10.7% in the case of diet with lard and by 14% with sunflower oil) and in liver (by 20% in the case of diet with lard and by 23% with sunflower oil). Similarly oat bran decreased the level of total cholesterol in the blood serum: by 19% in the case of diet with lard and by 22% with sunflower oil; and in liver by 22 and 27%, respectively. Amaranth and oat bran did not influence HDL-cholesterol in the blood of rats. The influence of amaranth and oat bran on the concentration of triglycerides in the blood serum depended on the kind of fats in a diet.

"The Australian oat cultivar Yarran is unacceptable for human food use due to poor flavour, colour and texture. It has a high lipid content which contains a high proportion of oleic acid. It was compared with an acceptable variety, Mortlock, which has a characteristically lower lipid content with a lower proportion of oleic acid, to study the effect of lipid content on pasting properties of the oat meal. The lipids of both varieties were extracted with petroleum ether and were added back into the defatted meals in sequential amounts. These meals were then tested for viscosity parameters. Both lipid content and composition significantly influenced the meal pasting properties. The peak viscosity and time to peak viscosity were negatively correlated with lipid content whereas setback and pasting temperature increased with increased lipid content. The lipids from Yarran and Mortlock had different effects on the pasting properties. The Mortlock lipid increased the final viscosity (FV) of the defatted meal of Yarran but showed little effect on the FV of its own cultivar. However, the results indicated that the lipid content/composition, although affecting pasting characteristics substantially, were not as important as other meal properties in controlling acceptability for human food use.

"Oat flour has preserving properties that have been attributed to the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds, particularly hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates. This work compares extraction methods based on methanol and propan-2-ol for the removal of oat antioxidants from milled oats. The efficiency of the extraction method was determined by measuring the concentration of total phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity based on an oxidation reaction of beta-carotene with linoleic acid in an emulsion. A novel method was also used based on the quenching of light generated from the chemiluminescence reaction between cytochrome c, tert- butylhydroperoxide (t-BHPO) and luminol. The chemiluminescence method proved to be reliable, rapid and sensitive. Both propan-2-ol and methanol extraction methods yielded oat extracts with antioxidant activity. The propan-2-ol extract contained approximately 70% of the activity measured in the methanol extract. Despite the lower yield, the industrial advantages of the latter method are discussed.

"The intestinal contents viscosities of oat-based breakfast cereals and muffins were examined. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were adapted for four days to a semipurified diet (AIN-76A). Following an overnight fast, the animals were meat-fed 5 g of either the AIN-76A diet (containing 5% cellulose), the AIN-76A diet containing 2% guar gum, whole-grain oat flour, one of five cereals (corn flakes, cooked oatmeal, uncooked oatmeal, cooked oar bran, or Cheerios), or one of two types of muffins (containing whole-grain oat flour or oatmeal). Two hours after presentation of the meal, the animals were killed, the small intestines removed, and the contents collected. The contents were centrifuged, and the viscosity values of the undiluted supernatants were determined. The supernatant viscosity from rats fed the AIN-76A diet was negligible (<5 mPa.sec), whereas that from rats fed guar gum was high (396 +/- 117 mPa.sec). Of the cereals fed, corn flakes resulted in the lowest viscosity (<5 mPa.sec). However, all oat-based cereals resulted in high intestinal contents supernatant viscosity levels (cooked oatmeal 368 +/- 128, uncooked oatmeal 307 +/- 107, cooked oat bran 301 +/- 85, Cheerios 199 +/- 58, mPa.sec) with no statistically significant differences. The intestinal contents viscosity values for the whole-grain oat flour muffin and oatmeal muffin were 233 +/- 52 and 111 +/- 26 mPa.sec, respectively, a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05).

"Experiments were conducted to determine the relationship, if any, between lipase activity and the metabolism of lipids during malting (germination) of oat (Avena sativa L.) seed. During the course of malting, concentration of the free fatty acid fraction increased markedly at the expense of me neutral lipid fraction (predominantly triacylglycerides), while the initially high lipase activity (most of which is located in the surface layers of the grains) decreased by approximate to 40%. The fatty acid compositions of total and neutral lipid fractions were stable during malting, but there were marked changes in the free fatty acid and phospholipid fractions. In a comparison among 12 hulled and hull-less genotypes, there were no significant regressions between the quantitative changes in lipid fractions and lipase activities. Brief treatments with chemicals or hot H2O that partially or completely inhibited lipase activity had various effects on subsequent quantitative changes in lipid fractions, but these changes were not consistent with the inhibitions in lipase activity observed. It was concluded that the degradation in triacylglycerides and increase in free fatty acids observed during oat malting were not controlled by the level of total lipase activity. Rather, it was suggested that oat may have another lipase present in the cells where the oil bodies are located that hydrolyzes triacylglycerides from the oil bodies during germination. Further research is needed to substantiate this hypothesis.",1159,0,0,99,99,0,0,0,3,2,226
"Previous studies have shown that the presence of several hepatic I-compounds, i.e., age-dependent covalent DNA modifications, is related to the presence of a natural ingredient, i.e., oats, in the diet. To demonstrate the biological significance of these novel DNA modifications, the effect of oat lipids on tumor initiation and promotion was examined in a rat fiver tumor model. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a single dose of diethylnitrosamine, a hepatic carcinogen, 24 hours after a 70% partial hepatectomy, then subjected to dietary phenobarbital promotion. Diets containing 10% oar lipids or corn oil were given during the initiation or the promotion stage of the tumorigenesis. At the end of the feeding, hepatic I-compounds were measured by P-32 postlabeling, and the number and volume of enzyme-altered hepatic foci, which served as preneoplastic markers, were measured in serial sections of liver by the method of quantitative stereology. Rats receiving oat lipids supplemented diets had five- To sixfold higher levels of I-compounds in their liver DNA than those receiving control diets. Meanwhile, rats receiving diets containing oat lipids during promotion had significantly smaller numbers and reduced volume of altered hepatic foci compared with those fed the control diet containing corn oil. These observations support the hypothesis that some I-compounds, e.g., the oats-specific I-compounds, are novel DNA modifications related to nutrient metabolism. The diet containing oat lipids may have chemopreventive activities, as demonstrated in this model system.",1160,1,1,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,233
"The purpose of this research was to study the effects of initial moisture levels and extrusion temperatures on bulk density, water absorption and water solubility indexes, viscosity, and color of extruded oat products. The dehulled grains were ground in a Brabender Quadrumat Senior mill and the coarse fraction, with higher amounts of crude protein, lipids, and dietary fiber content, were conditioned to moisture levels of 15.5-25.5% and extruded in a Brabender single-screw laboratory extruder. The water absorption index of extrudates were relatively low (4.16-6.35 g gel/g sample) but increased as the initial moisture of the raw material as well as the extrusion temperature was elevated. The water solubility index was inversely proportional to the extrusion temperature. Initial viscosity of the paste increased with the increase of raw material moisture and extrusion temperature, while the maximum viscosity (at a constant temperature) diminished with the increase of temperature. Products with lower values of L* (luminosity) and greater values of a* (red) and b* (yellow) were obtained at high moisture rates and at a 120 degrees C extrusion temperature.",1161,0,99,0,0,99,0,0,3,2,176
"Four oat cultivars adapted for soil and climate conditions in the southern region of Brazil were evaluated for protein nutritive value. Evaluations were done both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro evaluation was done by essential amino acid profile, available lysine, amino acid scoring, and protein digestibility corrected amino acid-scoring (PDCAAS). Nitrogen balance indices and PER were determined in vivo with rats. In all four cultivars (UFP-15, UFP-16, CTC-03, UFRGS-14), lysine was the most limiting amino acid. Available lysine, amino acid score and PDCAAS were highest for cultivar UFRGS-14 and lowest for CTC-03. When compared to casein, only nitrogen retention for UFRGS-14 did not differ statistically (p > 0.05); all other indices of protein quality were inferior to casein for the oat cultivars. The oat cultivars tended to be identical among themselves, except for apparent protein digestibility which was significantly higher in the UFRGS-14 and CTC-03 cultivars. On average, the PER values of the oat cultivars were 82% of casein; the net protein utilization was 88% of casein as determined in vivo and 49% by the estimation in vitro (PDCAAS).",1162,0,1,0,99,0,1,0,3,1,181
"The influence of oat bran oligosaccharides on carbohydrate utilization and fermentation end-products was studied with reference to three different lactic acid bacteria (LAB: Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lacrobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis). The main results were that all three LAB utilized oat beta-gluco-oligosaccharides, while only L. plantarum utilized xylo-oligosaccharides. The main products of LAB metabolism were lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid and ethanol. The results indicated that oat beta-gluco-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides induce LAB to form the end-products of a typical mixed-acid fermentation. The formation of mixed-acid production from xylo-oligosaccharides was mainly due to the starvation of cells. This study indicates that oat bran oligosaccharides affect both qualitatively and quantitatively the fermentation end-products of LAB grown on these substrates. This should be taken into account when selecting strains for new fermented cereal based food products. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V; All rights reserved.",1163,99,1,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,141
"The inhibitory activities toward the lipoxygenase action on linoleic acid were quantified and compared from different fractions derived from oat fiber. Based on these findings, a suitable procedure that yields a fraction with the high inhibitory activity was developed. The unit operations of the procedure involve alkali aqueous extraction followed by pH adjustment and separations of insoluble fiber particles from soluble extracts. The inhibitory activity was most effectively extracted into the solution using an extraction media with pH 10. By relowering the pH of the alkali aqueous extract, the inhibitory activity could be collected as a precipitate. Such a fraction comprised 7.2% of the fiber dry matter. Compared to the untreated oat fiber, the inhibitory activity was purified 17-fold and the yield of the activity was 125%. Such a fraction had high protein (88% w/w) and lipid (12%) contents, whereas the carbohydrate content (3%) was low.",1164,99,1,0,1,99,2,0,1,2,146
"Background: Psyllium and oat bran have been shown to lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels in different populations. Hypercholesterolemia is prevalent in the Northern part of Mexico and might be associated to dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle. Methods: Sedentary normal (cholesterol<200 mg/dL) (n=36) and hypercholesterolemic (cholesterol>220 mg/dL) (n=30) men from the Northern part of Mexico aged 20 to 45 years of age participated in an 8-week study to determine the effects of dietary soluble fiber, either psyllium or oat bran, in lowering plasma LDL cholesterol in this population. Fiber was administered by feeding the subjects an amount of cookies (100 g) equivalent to 1.3 or 2.6 g/day of soluble fiber from psyllium or oat bran, respectively. Subjects were randomly allocated to three groups: a control group consuming cookies with wheat bran, a known source of fiber with no cholesterol lowering effects, psyllium, or oat bran. Results: Food frequency questionnaires indicated that subjects from the three groups had similar intakes of foods classified as hypercholesterolemic (p>0.05). Plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations were reduced by an average of 22.6 and 26% in the psyllium and oat bran groups (p<0.001) while a non-significant reduction of 8.4% was observed in the hypercholesterolemic individuals from the control group. No effects on plasma HDL or triglycerides levels were observed among the three dietary treatments except for hypercholesterolemic individuals supplemented with oat bran where a 28% reduction in plasma triglycerides was observed after 8 weeks (p<0.01). Conclusion: These results indicate that psyllium and oat bran are efficacious in lowering plasma LDL cholesterol in both normal and hypercholesterolemic individuals from this population.",1165,1,0,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,262
"Brans from rice, oats, corn, and wheat were cooked in a twin-screw extruder at either high or low energy input, and their cholesterol-lowering effects were compared with those of unprocessed brans when fed to four-week-old male golden Syrian hamsters (n = 10 per treatment) for three weeks. Peanut oil was added to oat, corn, and wheat bran during the extrusion process to match the oil content of rice bran. Diets contained 10% total dietary fiber, 10.3% fat, 3% nitrogen, and 0.3% cholesterol. Plasma and liver cholesterol and total liver lipids were significantly lower with low-energy extruded wheat bran compared with unprocessed wheat bran. Extrusion did not alter the hypocholesterolemic effects of rice, oat, or corn brans. Plasma and liver cholesterol levels with corn bran were similar to those with oat bran. Relative cholesterol-lowering effects of the brans, determined with pooled (extruded and unextruded) bran data, were rice bran > oat bran > corn bran > wheat bran. Rice bran diets resulted in significantly lower levels of total plasma cholesterol and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with all other brans. Total liver cholesterol and liver cholesterol concentrations (mg/g) were significantly lower with high-energy extruded rice bran compared with the cellulose control group. Plasma cholesterol and total liver cholesterol values with low-energy extruded wheat bran were similar to those with rice bran (unextruded or extruded) diets. Lowered cholesterol with rice bran diets may result in part from greater lipid and sterol excretion with these diets. Results with low-energy extruded wheat bran suggest that this type of processing may improve the potential for lowering cholesterol with wheat bran products.",1166,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,267
"A method using methanolic sulphuric acid as transmethylating reagent was developed for determining the fatty acid composition of lipids of oats. The method was optimised for reaction conditions and applied to the determination of the fatty acid composition of lipids of a number of varieties of Australian oats grown in several locations. Thirteen fatty acids were detected with oleic, linoleic and palmitic acids comprising more than 95% of the total fatty acids. Total lipid content of the oats was positively related to the proportion of stearic (r=0.32) and oleic (r=0.81) acids and negatively correlated with the proportion of palmitic (r= -0.64), linoleic (r= -0.39) and linolenic (r= -0.65) acids. Significant positive correlations were found between total lipid content and absolute content of the major fatty acids (r=0.67 similar to 0.98), except for linolenic acid (r=0.12). Environment had significant effects on fatty acid composition, but variety was the controlling factor. The broad sense heritability estimated from individual plot ranged from 69 to 73% and that from the average of three replications and eight locations ranged from 94 to 98% for the major fatty acids. It is possible to improve fatty acid composition of oats by breeding procedures. (C) 1998 Academic Press.",1167,99,99,99,1,99,1,0,0,4,200
"A total of 56, 56, 54, 51, and 55 oats samples used for feed production were collected randomly after the 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 crops, respectively, from farms located in an area of southwest Germany. Deoxynivalenol (DON), 3- and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-,15-ADON), nivalenol (NIV), fusarenon-X (FUS-X), T-2 toxin (T-2), HT-2 toxin (HT-2) and diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) were determined by gas chromatography with mass selective detection (GC-MS) zearalenone (ZEA), alpha and beta-zearalenol (alpha-,beta-ZOL) by GC-MS or by HPLC. DON was the major toxin with incidences at 49-85% and mean levels in positive samples of 52-302 mu g/kg. Incidences of ZEA, 3-ADON, NIV, HT-2, and T-2 were at 20-37, 0-30, 18-67, 0-29. and 27-61%, respectively, with mean levels in positive samples at 8-25, 5-63, 11-192, 205-296, and 20-244 mu g/kg, respectively. alpha- and beta-ZOL and DAS were not detected in any sample. 15-ADON and FUS-X were assayed in samples from 1987, 1991 and 1992, 15-ADON was detected in 9, 4 and 0% of samples, with an average of 9 and 18 mu g/kg, respectively, FUS-X was not detected.

"Generally, stool weight is significantly increased by adding sources of insoluble fiber to the diet. Comparable amounts of fiber provided by wheat and oat brans have the same effect on daily stool output, even though >90% of wheat bran fiber but only 50-60% of oat bran fiber is insoluble. To determine the bases for these increases in stool weight, stool samples collected from 5 men in 2 constant diet studies that determined the effects of wheat and oat brans on large-bowel physiology were fractionated by using a physicochemical procedure into plant, bacterial, and soluble fractions, which were weighed and analyzed for sugar content and composition. Nitrogen, crude fat, and ash outputs were also determined. Wheat bran increased the fecal concentration of sugars and mass of plant material more than did oat bran, whereas oat bran increased fecal bacterial mass more. Each fiber source increased nitrogen, ash, and fat excretion, but excretion of fat was greater with oat bran. The apparent digestibility of plant-derived neutral sugars decreased significantly when wheat but not oat bran was consumed. The apparent digestibility of neutral sugars provided by wheat bran was 56%; the apparent digestibility of those provided by oat bran was 96%. We conclude that bacteria and lipids are major contributors to the increase in stool weight with oat bran consumption, whereas undigested plant fiber is responsible for much of the increase in stool weight with wheat bran consumption. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that oat bran increases stool weight by providing rapidly fermented soluble fiber in the proximal colon for bacterial growth, which is sustained until excretion by fermentation of the insoluble fiber.",1169,1,0,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,271
"Hydrothermal treatments, which are routine in oat processing, have profound effects on oat flour dough rheological properties. The influence of roasting and steam treatments of oat grain on dough mixing and breadbaking properties was investigated when hydrothermally treated oat flour was blended with wheat flour. Roasting of oat grain (105 degrees C, 2 hr) resulted in oat flours that were highly detrimental to wheat flour dough mixing properties and breadbaking quality. Steaming (105 degrees C, 20 min) or a combination of roasting and steaming of oat grain significantly improved the breadbaking potential of the oat flours. The addition of oat flours increased water absorption and mixing requirements of the wheat flour dough and also decreased bread loaf volume. However, at the 10% substitution level, steamed oat flours exhibited only a gluten dilution effect on bread loaf volume when wheat starch was used as a reference. Oat flour in the breadbaking system decreased the retrogradation rate of bread crumb starch. The results indicate that adequate hydrothermal treatments of oat grain are necessary for oat flour breadbaking applications. Steamed oat flours used at a 10% level retarded bread staling without adversely affecting the loaf volume.",1170,99,99,0,1,0,1,0,2,2,193
"The objectives of this study were to determine the chemical and ruminal nutrient degradability characteristics of two hulled (Calibre and AC Mustang) and one hull-less (AC Belmont) oat varieties. Ruminal nutrient degradability characteristics of the oat varieties were determined relative to barley using one ruminally fistulated cow. Neutral (NDF) and acid (ADF) detergent fibre levels were higher (P < 0.05) in hulled than hull-less oats. Hulled AC Mustang had higher (P < 0.05) NDF and ADF content than hulled Calibre. Starch content was higher (P < 0.05) in AC Belmont (590 g kg(-1)) than Calibre (457 g kg(-1)) and was higher in Calibre than AC Mustang (415 g kg(-1)). Crude protein was higher (P < 0.05) in hull-less than hulled oat. Both hulled varieties had similar CP content (average 124 g kg(-1)). Estimated digestible energy value was highest (P < 0.05) for AC Belmont (16.94 MJ kg(-1)), intermediate for Calibre (14.18 MJ kg(-1)) and lowest for AC Mustang (13.34 MJ kg(-1)). Ruminal dry matter and NDF degradability were higher (P < 0.05) in hull-less than barley and was higher in barley than hulled oats. Ruminal starch degradability exceeded 900 g kg(-1) for all tested feeds and had the order AC Belmont = barley > Calibre = AC Mustang. It was concluded that oat varieties used in this study varied considerably in their chemical composition and ruminal degradability. When compared with barley, hulled oats had lower while hull-less oats had higher ruminal degradability. (C) 1998 SCI.",1172,99,1,99,99,1,2,0,0,3,245
"A drink based on oats has been developed with new technology. In this study the effects of this oat milk, soya milk and cow's milk on plasma lipid, glucose, insulin, and antioxidant status (measured as the ability of serum to suppress the formation of the radical cation ABTS(.+)) were compared in 24 healthy men and women. Half of the subjects (group A) consumed 0.75-1 liters/day of oat milk and soya milk for 4 weeks each, and the other half (group B) consumed oat milk and cow's milk for two 4-week periods. In the combined groups A plus B the oat milk regimen resulted in decreased plasma cholesterol (4%) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (9%) levels as compared with baseline, but no changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and triglyceride values were observed. Also soya milk consumption resulted in decreased LDL cholesterol concentrations. The only significant plasma lipid change observed during consumption of cow's milk was an increase in HDL cholesterol. No consistent changes in body weight, fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, and antioxidant status occurred after consumption of any milk regimen. A significant correlation between baseline antioxidant status and total plasma cholesterol was found (r = -0.56). It is proposed that the high content of P-glucans in oat milk was responsible for the decreased plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations, but the effect could also be due to a replacement of saturated fat in the customary diet by unsaturated fat. It is concluded that oat milk can be used as an alternative to other milk drinks by subjects who would benefit from reduced LDL cholesterol values.",1173,1,-1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,266
"Effects of hydrothermal treatments (steaming, roasting) of oat grain on beta-glucan extractability and rheological properties were tested on oat cultivars with low (Robert) and high (Marion) beta-glucan content. Steaming of grain reduced the amount of beta-glucan that could be extracted, compared with raw or roasted grain, but the extracts from steamed grain had much greater viscosity. Increased extraction temperatures increased the amount and the average relative molecular mass (M-r) value of beta-glucans extracted. In boiling water extractions, the average M-r values among raw, roasted and steamed oat samples were equivalent, but extracts from steamed oat grain had significantly higher intrinsic viscosity than the extracts from roasted or raw oat grains. beta-Glucan solutions purified from steamed grain extracts were very viscous and highly pseudoplastic, as described by the power law equation. Oat beta-glucans from steamed samples were more viscoelastic than beta-glucans from roasted or raw oat samples. Because viscous properties of beta-glucans from boiling water extracts are influenced by hydrothermal treatments without affecting polymer molecular weight, polymer interaction with the solvent must be affected. Steaming may disrupt intramolecular cross-linkings in native beta-glucan, allowing a linear chain configuration to generate greater viscosity.",1174,99,99,99,99,1,1,0,0,4,190

Significant increases in the total faecal concentration of carboxylic acids (P<0.05 after 1 week and P<0.01 after 3 weeks of intake), acetic acid (P<0.01 after 3 weeks of intake) and propionic acid (P<0.01 after 3 weeks of intake and P<0.05 eight days after intake ceased) were recorded in the RHL group, indicating increased fermentation in the colon. In both groups a significant increase was obtained in the concentration of faecal lactic acid (P<0.001 after 1 and 3 weeks of intake). No changes were seen in the concentration of faecal butyrate. The numbers of faecal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli increased significantly in both groups after 3 weeks of intake. Sulphite-reducing clostridia rapidly decreased in the group receiving the product with Lb. plantarum DSM 9843 after 1 week of intake, and then also in the pure rose-hip group after 3 weeks of intake. No changes were seen in the numbers of total anaerobes, Gram-negative anaerobes or total aerobes during administration. Lb. plantarum DSM 9843 was recovered in faeces from all volunteers in the RHL group.

"The solution rheological behaviors of OATRIM-10 and cooked oat bran were investigated. The rheological properties of the materials were investigated using both thixotropic loop and small-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments. The cooked oat bran exhibited shear-thinning behavior during a thixotropic loop experiment over a shear rate range of 0-250/sec. The shear-thinning behavior was reproduced during the measurement of a second thixotropic loop, in contrast, OATRIM-10 exhibited an unexpected region of shear-thickening behavior at 20-80/sec. The shear-thickening and subsequent sheer-thinning regions for OATRIM-10 could be described by a transient network model indicating that the shear-thickening behavior is caused by a shear-induced entangled network that is partially disentangled at higher shear rates. Subsequent thixotropic loop experiments displayed the shear-thickening region for OATRIM-10, indicating that the network structure can be reformed during the imposition of a sheer field. Small-amplitude oscillatory shear data for cooked oat bran can be described reasonably well using a generalized linear viscoelastic (GLV) model. The oscillatory shear data obtained for OATRIM-10 could not be described by the GLV model. OATRIM-10 exhibited a distinctive plateau centered at 10/sec, and the low frequency response of storage modulus G' decreased with a much larger slope in frequency than was predicted by the GLV model.",1177,99,99,0,0,99,0,0,2,3,201
"The US population is aging rapidly and, within the next 25 years, 20-25% will be over age 60. This creates a vast new market for age-specific products and increases the responsibility of food scientists and nutritionists to provide appropriate foods for older adults. Many older individuals are energy deficient and need to be encouraged to consume more food in order to maintain body weight and health, but need to decrease the calories from fat in their diets. Many of these older individuals are not inclined to eat foods that they enjoy for fear that these foods may be detrimental to their health (de Castro, 1993), or they have lost their gustational abilities to the degree that these foods are no longer enjoyable. This research looks at a possible solution to both problems by replacing fat in a favorite food of older adults and adjusting the flavor levels of this product. Frankfurters were made from mechanically deboned poultry meat in which standard commercial formulation was compared to three flavoring treatments using oat bran as a fat replacer (6% oat bran, 30% H2O). Mixed spices (traditional saucisson) were added to two of these treatments in standard and double proportions. Participants were 71 individuals over the age of 65 in varying levels of health from four regional care facilities. Seven gram, three-digit-coded samples were evaluated at 60 degrees C, and scored on a nine-point hedonic scale. A significant (alpha = 0.0004) preference was shown for the double-spiced frank.

"Scientific studies support recommendations to increase dietary soluble fiber as part of hyperlipidemia treatment. Rice bran contains minimal soluble fiber, but rice bran oil has a hypolipidemic effect. Full-fat rice bran was compared with oat bran and a rice starch placebo in hyperlipidemic humans to see if it might have a role in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Moderately hypercholesterolemic (5.95-8.02 mmol/L), nonsmoking, nonobese adults were studied in a 6-wk, randomized, double-blind, noncross-over trial, Three groups added 84 g/d of a heat-stabilized, full-fat, medium-grain rice bran product (n = 14), oat bran product (n = 13) or rice starch placebo (n = 17) to their usual low-fat diet. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), apoA1 and apoB were measured before and at the end of the supplementation period. Serum cholesterol decreased significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) by 8.3 +/- 2.4% and 13.0 +/- 1.8% in the rice bran and oat bran groups, respectively, but there was no change in the rice starch group. This change was attributable to LDL-C, which decreased by 13.7 +/- 2.8% in the rice bran group and 17.1 +/- 2.4% in the oat bran group (P less than or equal to 0.05), Serum apoB decreased proportionately. There was no consistent effect on triglycerides within each group and HDL-C and apoA concentrations did not change. The LDL-C:HDL-C ratio decreased significantly in the rice bran and oat bran groups. Stabilized, full-fat rice bran or oat bran, added to the prudent diet of hyperlipidemic adults, similarly reduced cholesterol and LDL-C and improved lipid ratios in 78% of these individuals.

"Oxidative stability of milk fats from cows offered naked oats-and barley-based diets were compared in shelf-life tests using the Schaal Oven Test at 63 degrees C, and determination of peroxide and thiobarbituric acid values. Milk fat from cows offered the diet containing naked oats, although containing a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids, had a significantly longer oxidation induction period (13 days) than milk fat from cows offered the control (barley-based) diet (9 days). However, sensory testing of the milk fats indicated that a perceptible odour difference was apparent between stored (63 degrees C) and unstored milk fats after 3 days of storage irrespective of the diet fed. It is possible that the odours perceived may have originated from the cows' diets or from hydrolytic rancidity reactions.

"Samples of hull-less oat,genotypes from the Cooperative Naked Oat Test grown in Ottawa, ON, and Aberdeen, ID, were analyzed for their potential as a food malt. Malted oats had a lower concentration of petroleum ether-extractable lipid, but a much higher percentage of the lipid was in the form of free fatty acids. About 5% less starch and slightly more N was found in malted oats than in unmalted. Malted oats contained approximate to 8% soluble carbohydrate. During the germination phase of malting, nearly all the beta-glucan was degraded. alpha-Amylase activity of malted oats approached that of malting barleys, but diastatic power was much lower. Greats of hulled cultivars grown at Madison, WI, were malted and analyzed with similar results. Because the increased levels of free fatty acids in the malted grains may lead to the development of rancid flavors, a method to curtail their increase or selections of genotypes with a minimum increase during malting may be necessary to produce a useful malted food product.",1183,1,99,99,99,1,2,0,0,3,165
"A reversed-phase ion-pair liquid chromatographic (LC) method was developed for analysis of steam-rolled oat (SRO) baits fortified with either chlorophacinone or diphacinone. Baits were prepared with and without paraffin wax. Chlorophacinone or diphacinone was extracted from wax-free SRO baits with 5 mM tetrabutylammonium phosphate methanolic ion-pairing solution. Wax baits were initially extracted with petroleum ether and then cleaned up by liquid extraction into methanolic ion-pairing solution containing 20% water. SRO extracts were analyzed with reversed-phase ion-pair LC. Chlorophacinone and diphacinone were quantified by UV absorption at 325 nm. Recoveries from SRO fortified with chlorophacinone at 25 and 150 mu g/g were 90.7 and 90.8%, respectively, whereas for diphacinone at the same levels, recoveries were 93.5 and 92.3%, respectively. Recoveries from wax baits fortified at 25 and 75 mu g/g chlorophacinone were 98.5 and 100%, respectively, whereas for diphacinone at the same levels, recoveries were 93.6 and 98.0%, respectively. Method limits of detection for chlorophacinone and diphacinone in SRO baits were estimated to be 1.0 and 0.76 mu g/g, respectively. Method limits of detection for chlorophacinone and diphacinone in wax baits were estimated to be 4.2 and 2.8 mu g/g, respectively.",1184,99,1,99,0,0,1,0,2,2,190
"Calorie-reduced yogurts that were fortified with 1.32% oat fiber were prepared from lactose-hydrolyzed milk, alone and supplemented with 2 and 4% sucrose or with 1.6, 3.6, and 5.5% fructose. Treated samples were compared with unsweetened yogurt and with yogurts sweetened with 2, 4, and 6% sucrose. Addition of 5.5% fructose increased fermentation time by 60%, slowing down the production of lactic, pyruvic, acetic, and propionic acids and the consumption of hippuric and erotic acids. Lactose hydrolysis had an inhibitory effect on starter activity at the beginning of fermentation and a stimulatory effect at the end of fermentation. Fiber addition led to increases in concentrations of acetic and propionic acid. Lactobacilli counts were lower in samples treated with fructose. The use of hydrolyzed milk had a stimulatory effect on total bacteria and lactobacilli counts throughout the cold storage period. After 28 d of storage, lactobacilli counts were consistently higher in fiber-fortified yogurts, but total bacteria counts were lower. Apparent viscosity increased with the addition of sweetener and fiber. Lactose-hydrolyzed and fructose yogurts had the highest viscosity values. Samples sweetened with sucrose received the highest scores for flavor. Fiber addition decreased overall flavor quality. The lactose-hydrolyzed yogurts received the highest flavor scores, independent of fiber fortification. Fiber addition improved the body and texture of unsweetened yogurts but lowered overall scores for body and texture in yogurts sweetened with sucrose.",1185,0,1,-1,99,99,1,1,1,2,227
"An experiment was conducted to determine the apparent deal digestibility of amino acids and the digestible energy (DE) content of two samples of naked oats (Avena sativa cv Bandicoot) and to compare these parameters in wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Machete) and dehulled oats (greats; Avena sativa cv Echidna). Four Large White male pigs were fitted with simple T-piece heal cannulae and allocated to experimental diets in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Amino acid digestibility coefficients were determined after continuous eight hour collections of digesta over two consecutive days using acid-insoluble ash as an indigestible marker. Digestible energy was determined using grab samples of faeces. No significant difference between the four test cereals was found in the digestibility of all amino acids, except for proline and lysine. The apparent heal digestibility of lysine in wheat (0.87) and two samples of naked oats (0.89 and 0.82, respectively) was lower (P < 0.05) than dehulled oats (0.91). The mean DE value of the naked oats samples was 16.96 MJ kg(-1) (air-dry basis). The results suggest that Bandicoot naked oats and dehulled oats are superior amino acid and DE sources to wheat and have potential for use in weaner and grower pig diets.

"Anther culture ability was tested for 44 oat (Avena saliva L.), six naked oat (A. sativa L., naked type) and 15 wild oat (Avena sterilis L.) genotypes, in addition to progeny of five intraspecific crosses of A. sativa and two interspecific crosses of A. sativa x A. sterilis. Anther culture response was affected considerably by genotype. Thirty one oat genotypes responded by callus growth on induction medium and seven of them produced embryo structures, two of the lines consistently. All naked oat genotypes produced embryo structures. Embryo production rates for the wild oat lines were comparable with those for the naked oat genotypes, and higher than for oat: 13 of the 15 genotypes tested produced embryo structures. plant regeneration was possible only from wild oat. The regeneration ability was inherited in the progeny of the A, sativa x A. sterilis cross cv. Puhti x CAV 2648. The response of anthers of oat genotypes was inhibited by auxin on the induction medium, while naked oat, wild oat and A. sativa x A. sterilis crosses responded better on a medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid.",1187,1,99,1,99,1,3,0,0,2,181
"The optimising of the composition of ingredients has a major effect on the properties of low-fat products. The purpose of this research was to assess the effects of added tapioca starch (ranging from 0-30 g/kg), oat fibre (ranging from 0-20 g/kg) and whey protein (ranging from 0-20 g/kg) on the physical and organoleptic characteristics of low-fat beef burgers. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to study the simultaneous effects of these three ingredients. Significant models of regression were ascertained for cooking properties (yield and water holding capacity), the sensory attributes of tenderness and juiciness, and all mechanical texture attributes. The level of tapioca starch (TS) influenced the models to the greatest extent. Irs effect on the cooking properties was highly significant, positive and linear. The presence of TS had a large negative linens effect on Warner-Bratzler and Kramer shear forces. For each significant regression model, TS exerted a linear effect, and in some cases a quadratic effect. Both oat fibre and whey protein had a limited influence. There was no evidence of interactions among the variables. The results indicate that as the TS in low-fat beef burgers increases a succulent and tender low-fat product is obtained.",1188,0,1,1,99,1,3,0,1,1,196
"The antioxidative properties of native flours derived from three types of faba beans in different concentrations, as well as flours from dehulled soybeans and oats without husk, were determined using the Schaal oven test. The antioxidative potential was expressed by the protection factor against the oxidation of lard or sunflower oil. All three raw materials showed pronounced antioxidative potential, but native flour from oats had an exceptionally strong antioxidative effect. Although steaming of all three flours reduced their antioxidative potential, it was most detrimental to oat flour. Tempeh fermentation increased the antioxidative effects in all three raw materials, where the highest increase was obtained with flour derived from faba beans. also tested during the production of tempeh from oats. Fermentation time, as well as the water/oat flour ratio, were found to have a highly significant influence (P < 0.01).",1189,1,1,-1,1,1,4,1,0,0,139
"Oat extract has been shown to modify blood glucose response and fasting lipids after dietary incorporation although some abdominal discomfort and increased flatulence were noted. To determine the extent of gas production, hydrogen and methane were determined after tolerance tests containing cooked and uncooked oat extract and after dietary incorporation. Breath gases were determined before and periodically after tolerance tests. Study 1: While consuming a maintenance diet, 24 subjects (55.3-112.5 kg body weight) underwent a tolerance test (1 g carbohydrate/kg body wt) of glucose (GTT, 1700 kJ/100 g) or uncooked, baked, or boiled pudding [2191 kJ/100 g carbohydrate, (0.67 glucose and 0.33 oat extract containing 10 g/100 g beta-glucan)]. Hydrogen and methane expiration after all tolerance tests with the oat extract puddings, regardless of cooking method, was significantly higher than expirations after the GTT. Cooking the oat extract did not significantly change hydrogen or methane expiration. Study 2: Twenty-three subjects consumed a maintenance diet followed by the incorporation of oat extracts (50 g/8.33 MJ, 1 or 10 g/100 g beta-glucan) to the diet in a crossover pattern. A GTT and a tolerance test containing 0.67 g glucose and 0.33 g of the respective oat extract/kg body weight were consumed after the maintenance and oat extract diet periods. Breath hydrogen was significantly higher after both oat extract tolerance tests than after the GTT. Hydrogen excretion after the 10% beta-glucan oat extract was higher at 4, 5 and 6 h than after the 1% beta-glucan oat extract; breath methane was not significantly different. These data indicate that cooking did not alter the influence of oat extracts on intestinal function, and increased beta-glucan marginally increased hydrogen expiration.",1190,99,0,1,1,0,2,0,2,1,274
The effects of oat and soya lecithins and their hydrolysates on crystallisation of wheat starch gel and on bread structure were studied. In baking studies the lecithins were compared with commonly used commercial emulsifiers. Soya lecithin hydrolysate retarded starch gel crystallisation and bread staling as effectively as the best commercial emulsifiers. The oat lecithins were interesting. They did not affect significantly the starch gel crystallisation but both of them retarded bread staling much more effectively than the soya lecithin. Oat lecithins were as good as the commercial Amidan indicating that glycolipids in oat lecithins slowed bread staling. (C) 1998 SCI.,1191,1,1,1,99,1,4,0,0,1,100

A significant correlation (r = 0.83; P < 0.005) between the contents of total and extractable mixed-linkage S-glucan was found. Reproducible increases in viscosity were noted for all samples when the finely ground samples were dispersed in phosphate buffer and viscosity development was followed for 100 min. Addition of mixed-linkage beta-glucanase greatly reduced the viscosity. addition of amyloglucosidase, with no detectable mixed-linkage beta-glucanase activity, increased viscosity, which could be related to an increased solubilisation of mixed-linkage beta-glucan. Highly significant correlations (r > 0.90) were found between the contents of both total and extractable mixed-linkage beta-glucan and viscosity after dispersion.

"It is well established that the consumption of wheat prolamins causes the characteristic symptoms of coeliac disease (CD) in subjects who are predisposed to it. There is currently much discussion about the role of oats in the pathogenesis of CD. Evidently, it is important that oats used for clinical studies are not contaminated with wheat. In this study, 38 oat samples were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): 30 samples consisted of flakes or grains and 8 probes were industrially processed oat diets. Wheat prolamin (gliadin) detection by ELISA showed that 16 of these samples contained less than the detection limit of 0.2 mg gliadin/100 g dry weight; 21 samples contained less than 2.8 mg gliadin/100 g dry weight and 1 sample reached 38 mg gliadin/100 g dry weight, clearly exceeding the allowed Swiss limit of 10 mg gliadin/100 g dry weight for gluten-free products. Spiking experiments showed that the wheat PCR system is about ten times more sensitive than the ELISA system, provided that the isolated DNA is fully amplifiable. Thus, wheat DNA could be detected by the wheat PCR system in ten samples with gliadin contents below the detection limit of the ELISA system used. Applying a eukaryote-specific 18S-PCR system the presence of amplifiable DNA was verified. Only two of eight samples of industrially processed oat products contained amplifiable DNA, the other six samples had no detectable DNA left. One sample was wheat-PCR positive. However, all eight samples contained detectable amounts of gliadin in the ELISA.",1194,1,-1,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,253
"Celiac disease is an intolerance to protein fractions in wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oats. When these grains are consumed by a person with celiac disease, they damage the mucosa of the small intestine, which eventually leads to malabsorption of nutrients. Patients are therefore advised to remove these grains from their diet, with lifelong adherence generally suggested. Although many dietitians and physicians consider this dietary prescription to be standard protocol, it is actually quite controversial. Whether oats can safely be consumed by persons with celiac disease has been debated since the gluten-free diet was first advocated more than 40 years ago. Historically, there have been several reasons for this debate, including the difficulty in identifying the precise amino acid sequence in gliadin that is responsible for toxicity; the differences in cereal chemistry between wheat and oats; and the lack of well-designed studies to assess the toxicity of oats. A growing body of evidence now suggests that moderate amounts of oats may be safely consumed by most adults with celiac disease. If further research continues to find no adverse effects from oat consumption, a consensus may emerge on the place of oats in the gluten-free diet. Ln the meantime, individual dietary prescriptions, routinely assessed for appropriateness using histologic and/or serologic studies, may be warranted to prevent unnecessary dietary restrictiveness and undesirable medical complications.",1195,-1,1,1,0,-1,2,2,1,0,222
"The extractability and molecular weight of beta-glucan in oat bran, oat bran muffins, and oat porridge and the changes taking place during processing and storage were studied. The beta-glucan was extracted using hot water and a thermostable alpha-amylase and by an in vitro system that simulated human digestion. Molecular weight (MW) of the extracted beta-glucan was determined using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. Hot-water treatment extracted 50-70% of total beta-glucan in oat bran samples and rolled oats. The chromatographic peak MW of extracted beta-glucan was in the 1.4-1.8 x 10(6) range. Using the in vitro digestion system, 12-33% of total beta-glucan in bran and rolled oats was solubilized, and peak MW was in the same range as beta-glucan extracted by hot-water treatment. In muffins, 30-85% of total beta-glucan was solubilized by in vitro digestion, with a major difference in extractability among muffins from different recipes. Peak MW of extracted beta-glucan was lower in all muffins when compared to original bran. During frozen storage, extractable beta-glucan decreased by >50% in all muffins, but no change in peak MW of extracted beta-glucan was detected.",1196,0,99,1,0,99,1,0,2,2,180
"Oat grain is routinely kilned and steamed before milling to develop flavor and to inactivate lipid-degrading enzymes. Heat treatments can significantly affect viscous properties, which have functional and nutritional importance. Oat flour slurries (23%, w/w, solids dry basis) made from steamed (for 20 min) or autoclaved (at 121 degrees C, 15 psi, for 10 min) grain developed high viscosities, whereas flour slurries made from raw or kilned (105 degrees C for 90 min) oats did not. Flour slurries made from raw greats, surface-sterilized by 1% hypochlorite, were more. viscous than untreated raw great flour slurries, suggesting that beta-glucan hydrolases on the surface of the groat caused the viscosity losses observed in raw or kilned greats. However, because viscosities developed by surface-sterilized greats were not as great as in steamed oat-flour slurries and because some roasting treatments also inactivated enzymes without enhancing viscosity, it appears steaming might also affect the beta-glucan polymer, resulting in its greater hydration in solution. Smaller particle size and higher incubation temperature also resulted in increased flour slurry viscosity, presumably because of increased hydration of the beta-glucan. Rmoval of lipids from steamed oat flour significantly increased the oat flour slurry viscosity, apparently by increasing the beta-glucan concentration in the flour.",1197,-1,1,1,99,1,3,1,0,1,203

"To determine the effects of partial replacement of fat and flour in foods with Z-Trim corn and oat fibers, brownies and ground beef patties containing Z-Trim were evaluated for flavor and texture characteristics. A cake-like brownie formulation containing 26% fat (control) was prepared with 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% fat replacement using four levels of Z-Trim corn fiber at 0.18, 0.36, 0.55, and 0.73% by weight of total ingredients. In samples containing fat replacer, the flour level was half that of the control. The calories per gram of brownie for the full-fat product was 3.4 compared to 1.6 for the brownie with 100% fat replacement and 50% flour replacement. A trained sensory panel reported that replacing either 50, 75, or 100% of the fat in addition to 50% of the flour with the addition of Z-Trim corn fiber significantly increased moistness, density, and cohesiveness compared to the control. The fat content of 89% fat-free ground beef was reduced to 93% fat-free with Z-Trim oat fiber or a Z-Trim/oatrim blend at 1 and 1.5% addition by weight with 10% water.

"A comparison of the effect of the process variables temperature and moisture on the extrusion behaviour of wheat starch, whole wheat meal and oat flour was made. The lipids content of wheat starch and whole wheat meal was also adjusted to 4% and 8% using wheat germ oil (WGO) to study its effect and to compare with oat flour, which has an oil level of about 8%. The extruder pressure, torque and specific mechanical energy and extrudate properties of expansion, water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSI) were analysed. Second-order polynomials were used to model the extruder response and product properties of extruded wheat starch and whole wheat meal with the process variables and WGO level. Wheat starch and meal behaved broadly similarly but differed from oats in pressure, expansion, WSI and WAI in their response to moisture content and temperature. Addition of WGO to wheat starch increased the expansion, whereas it had little effect on the wheat meal. WGO increased the upper bound WSI and decreased the lower bound WAI for starch or meal.

"The cholesterol-lowering effect of cereal grains has been associated with the soluble fiber component of dietary fiber. beta-Glucan is the major soluble fiber component of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and oat (Avena sativa L.). Much research has been conducted to determine the beta-glucan content of barley and oat genotypes from many different countries. However, genotypes of both crops always were grown in separate experiments, making direct comparisons between the two crops difficult. This study compares in the same experiment the beta-glucan content of nine barley and 10 oat genotypes grown at two locations in each of two years (i.e., four environments) in North Dakota. Averaged across genotypes, total beta-glucan content of barley and oat great was similar. Soluble beta-glucan content of oat great was greater than barley, and oat great had a greater ratio of soluble-to-total beta-glucan than barley. The soluble beta-glucan content and ratio of soluble to total beta-glucan content of the ''best'' barley genotypes were less than that of oat genotypes with the highest levels of these two traits.",1201,1,0,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,171
"Objective and subjects: Dietary fibre has been suggested to interfere with endogenous cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Therefore the effects of oat bran on the proportions of cholesterol synthesis precursors (squalene, Delta(8)-cholestenol, desmosterol and lathosterol), cholestanol and plant sterols (campesterol and beta-sitosterol) to cholesterol were analysed in serum of 36 hypercholesterolaemic subjects. Design: A randomized study of eight weeks duration where beta-glucan-rich oat bran (n = 20, subjects) or wheat bran (n = 16) was used as a part of a cholesterol lowering diet. Plant sterols and cholesterol synthesis precursors were analysed from frozen samples afterward. Results: In the oat-bran group, but not in the wheat bran group, serum total cholesterol declined transiently. The proportions of plant sterols and cholestanol in serum, which reflect cholesterol absorption efficiency were unchanged. However, the proportions of squalene appeared to be transiently increased during the study. Subjects with apolipoprotein E 4 allele had higher serum campesterol and sitosterol levels (suggestive of efficient cholesterol absorption) than those with homozygous apolipoprotein E 3 allele. Conclusions: Since the cholesterol precursors in serum reflecting endogenous cholesterol synthesis remained almost unchanged the reduction in the serum cholesterol level by oat bran treatment can not be ascribed to an inhibition of the endogenous cholesterol synthesis.",1202,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,2,3,0,205
"Soluble oat extracts have been used successfully in a number of diet studies to lower plasma blood lipids. One of the mechanisms proposed for this reduction in lipids is the production of short-chain fatty acids in the large intestine, which, in turn, may inhibit low-density lipoprotein cholesterol synthesis thereby limiting oxidation. Urinary excretion of malondialdehyde (MDA) is proportional to endogenous lipid peroxidation. The purpose of this report is to examine the effects of consuming oat extracts with low (1%) or high (10%) levels of soluble beta-glucans on lipid peroxidation as measured by urinary malondialdehyde excretion. Twenty-four subjects with moderately elevated cholesterol levels (6.0 mmol/L) were selected for the study. A I-week equilibration period was followed by two 5-week experimental periods during which defined diets contained the 1% or 10% oat extracts in a crossover design. Seventy-two-hr urine samples (3 x 24-hr) were collected at the end of each period Urinary levels of MDA excreted were 10-18% of dietary MDA consumed. Consumption of either of the oat extracts resulted in highly significant reductions in urinary excretion of malondialdehyde (P < 0.0001). These data would support the hypothesis that oar extracts inhibit endogenous lipid peroxidation by reduction of MDA (a marker for fatty acid oxidation); however, because no significant differences were found in MDA excretion after subjects consumed the two levels of beta-glucans, this is apparently not the responsible component. Further examination of this mechanism in the control of lipid metabolism is warranted. (C) Elsevier Science Inc. 1997.",1203,1,1,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,246
"To investigate the mechanisms behind the se rum cholesterol-lowering effect of oat fiber, we simultaneously measured postprandial lipid responses, serum lathosterol concentrations, and small bowel excretion of fat and sterols in ileostomy subjects given test meals high or low in oat fiber. Six ileostomy subjects (three women and three men) were served an oat-bran test meal (OB; 16.3 g fiber) and a wheat test meal (6.3 g fiber) in random order. After the postprandial 7-h period, a controlled, low-fat, cholesterol-free diet was served and ileostomy effluent was sampled throughout the 24-h period. Bile acid and fat excretion (24 h) increased by 93% and 146%, respectively (P < 0.05), and total and endogenous cholesterol excretion decreased by 14% and 19%, respectively (P < 0.05), after the OB test meal. The change in hepatic cholesterol synthesis was strongly related to the change in bile acid excretion (Spearman r = 0.89, P < 0.02). The postprandial chylomicron lipid concentration tended to be lower after the OB test meal (-43% for cholesterol, P = 0.07) whereas there was no difference in cholesterol absorption measured by isotope in five subjects. The main effect of the viscous oat beta-glucan seems to be related to increased bile acid excretion and subsequent changes in synthesis and endogenous excretion of cholesterol. An additional effect may have peen a delay in the micellar lipid solubilization process and a consequent reduction in the secretion of chylomicrons into the circulation.",1204,99,99,0,1,1,2,0,1,2,238
"Plasma membrane lipid composition of herbicide-resistant (R) and -susceptible (S) wild oat biotypes was analyzed to determine the basis for the differential effect of diclofop on the transmembrane electrogenic potential between the two biotypes and reduced herbicide uptake into protoplasts of the R biotype. In addition, Lipoxygenase (LOX) activity was examined in herbicide-treated and untreated R and S plants to determine its involvement in herbicide action and resistance. Overall, no significant differences in lipid composition were found between the two biotypes. Glycolipids represented 41 and 36%, phospholipids 29 and 37%, and free sterols 30 and 27% of the total plasma membrane lipid in the R and S biotypes, respectively No differences in LOX activity were observed between the herbicide-treated and untreated wild oat biotypes. It was concluded that differences in membrane transport of diclofop and its effect on plasma membrane potential in the R and S biotypes are not related to differences in membrane lipid composition or to differential effects of herbicides on LOX activity in the two biotypes.",1205,1,99,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,169

"Oat hull fiber is an insoluble source of dietary fiber, derived from the outermost layer of the oat grain. The effect of oat hull fiber on colonic function and serum lipids was investigated by conducting a controlled study on IO healthy males, aged 20-37, who ate, for two three-week periods, a controlled low fiber diet (13.1 g of nonstarch polysaccharide [NSP]/day), and the same diet with 25 g of oat hull fiber per day incorporated into foods, providing 17 g of NSP/day. Fecal weight increased from 113 +/- 10.4 to 155 +/- 10.8 g/day (P < 0.001) with no change in transit time or serum lipids. Fermentation of oat hull fiber was studied by analysis of feces for NSP. Excretion of NSP increased from 2.0 g/day excreted to 19.7 g/day, indicating that no degradation had occurred.

"Three mechanisms of oat milling were tested for laboratory-scale oat bran production. Oat bran consistent with AACC definition and commercially obtained product was generated with either roller-milling or impact-milling of greats, followed by sieving to retain larger particles. These bran preparations were enriched approximate to 1.7-fold in beta-glucan and ash, 1.4-fold in protein, and 1.1-fold in lipid. Bran finishing made further enrichments in protein, beta-glucan, and ash. Tempering oat (to 12% moisture for 20 min) improved bran yield from roller-milling nearly two-fold but had little effect on bran composition. Bran yield from the impact-type mill was significantly affected by grinding screen size. Oat bran obtained from a pearling mill was only slightly enriched in beta-glucan and protein, but it was more heavily enriched in ash and oil than brans from roller or impact mills. The pearling mill isolated the outer layers of the great directly, but because of its low beta-glucan composition it did not meet the AACC definition of oat bran, indicating a relatively uniform distribution of beta-glucan in the great.",1208,99,99,99,0,1,1,0,1,3,172
"The content and molecular weight (MW) of beta-glucan in extracts from a selection of oat and barley cultivars were compared using flow-injection analysis and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography From 60 to 75% of the beta-glucan was extracted from oat and waxy barley by hot water (90 degrees C) containing heat-stable alpha-amylase, whereas just 50-55% was extracted from nonwaxy barley. Consecutive extractions with hot water and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) extracted 65% (nonwaxy barley) or 75-80% (oat and waxy barley) of the total beta-glucan. An extraction with sodium hydroxide and sodium borohydride (NaOH/NaBH4) increased the percentage of beta-glucan extracted to 86-100% but decreased the MW.

"Three European and three North American oat cultivars (Avena sativa) and 10 wild Avena species were grown to maturity in pots at three nitrogen fertility levels. The yield and nitrogen content of plant parts, and the production and partitioning of dry matter and nitrogen were measured. Greats were also analysed for oil content and composition. Some wild species had high great oil(12-13%). Great nitrogen was higher in wild species (2.9-6.3%) than cultivars (1.5-2.7%). Increases in total yield and total nitrogen yield closely corresponded with increases in nitrogen fertility level. Two wild species, with great nitrogen contents significantly greater than those of all the cultivars at all fertility levels (A. maroccana, A. canariensis), also had total plant dry matter yields and total plant nitrogen yields that were not significantly different from those of a number of cultivars. The hull contributed substantially to dry matter and nitrogen yield in some wild species, and in two (ii. canariensis, A. maroccana) partitioning of both dry matter and nitrogen to the grain was not significantly different from those for most cultivars. There were significant genotype x fertility interactions for a number of characteristics, but there was no evidence that wild species had superior nitrogen economies at any fertility level.

These selections, along with two control cultivars, were analysed to determine their tocol(tocopherol and tocotrienol), protein, starch and beta-glucan concentrations. Selections were also compared by histochemical techniques that stained the oil bodies? protein and beta-glucan. Tocotrienol concentration was correlated with oil concentration (r(2)=0.83), but tocopherol concentration was not Tocotrienols are predominantly located in the endosperm. whereas tocopherols are concentrated in the germ. Tocotrienols are antioxidants and have cholesterol-lowering properties in humans and experimental animals. Protein and beta-glucan concentrations also increased with increasing oil concentration, whereas starch concentration decreased. The micrographs showed that oil and protein were distributed throughout the endosperm. Selections having greater oil and protein concentration by nuclear magnetic resonance and near infrared transmittance assay also showed increased fluorescence.

"Water hydration capacity data submitted by 10 participating laboratories was determined to be homogeneous among laboratories and within classes of oat products (whole rolled oats, instant oats, quick oats, and oat bran) utilized in the collaborative study. Results indicated that hydration capacities increased with decreasing granulation of rolled oat products. Method performance parameters obtained in this investigation were indicative of gravimetric analyses of this type with greater variability associated with rolled oat products of finer granulation. Within laboratory (RSDr) and among laboratory (RSDR) repeatabilities of 2.23 and 4.92, respectively, were determined for whole rolled oats. Reproducibility values (R) ranged from 7.4% for whale rolled oats to 21.9% for oat bran and instant oats, which were analyzed as Youden pairs. Corresponding repeatability values (r) ranged from 3.4% for whole rolled oats to 13.4% for instant oats.",1212,1,0,99,-1,99,1,1,1,2,135
"Kishk is a dried product usually made from yoghurt and parboiled 'cracked' wheat (Burghol) and is widely used in the region between the eastern Mediterranean and the Indian sub-continent. To evaluate the contribution of the cereal component to the overall character of Kishk, different cereal bases were prepared. Three varieties of barley and four of oats were processed in a manner similar to the production of Burghol. The traditional cracking process was successful for barley and oats, but it was very difficult to separate the husk from the oat product. The chemical composition of the 'cracked' cereals were compared with that of the original grains (minus the bran), and with the traditional wheat product (i.e. Burghol). The overall fibre content of the 'cracked' barley was lower by 5.1% while the phytic acid and beta-glucan contents were higher than the corresponding original cereal grain by 0.03 and 0.36%, respectively. In comparison with the original grain, the overall fibre content of the 'cracked' oats was also lower by similar to 1.43% while the beta-glucan content was 0.26% higher. The concentration of copper, calcium, zinc and manganese differed between the cereal grain and the 'cracked' product (p < 0.05). These differences emphasise the significance of cereal type on the properties of Burghol. (C) 1998 Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology.

"Kishk was made from a dough containing low-fat yoghurt, parboiled 'cracked' cereal (Burghol) and salt. The dough was then dried and ground to a flour. The composition and sensory properties of Kishk made from wheat, oat and barley Burghol were investigated. The chemical analysis (g 100 g(-1) on dry matter basis) of the Kishk fell within the following ranges: protein 18.2-20.6, fat 6.4-10.7 and carbohydrates 62.0-68.6. The moisture content averaged 8.4%, and the fibre and beta-glucan contents were highest in Kishk made with barley and oat Burghol, respectively. Lactic acid was the major organic acid present in the products. The mono-unsaturated fatty acid content (similar to 34%) was the highest in oat Kishk. Appreciable quantities of Fe, Cu and Mn were found in all the Kishks paralleling the mineral composition of the cereal of which it was made. The sensory profiles of a hot porridge-like gruel of nine samples of Kishk showed substantial differences between these products made with different cereals. Differences in mouth-feel (grainy, sticky and slimy character) were associated with cereal type. Partial least squares regression (PLS2) models derived from the chemical composition were successfully fitted, after cross-validation, for grainy, sticky and slimy character. Only the model for grainy character was of predictive value. (C) 1998 Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",1214,99,1,1,99,99,2,0,0,3,220
"The effect of oat bran- (OBD) and wheat bran-enriched diets (WED) on fatty acid composition of neutral lipids and phospholipids of rat lymphocytes and macrophages was investigated. In neutral lipids of lymphocytes, OBD reduced the proportion of palmitoleic acid (48%), whereas WED reduced by 43% palmitoleic acid and raised oleic (18%), linoleic (52%), and arachidonic (2.5-fold) acids. In neutral lipids of macrophages, OBD increased palmitic (16%) and linoleic (29%) acids and slightly decreased oleic acid (15%). The effect of WED, however, was more pronounced: It reduced myristic (60%), stearic (24%) and arachidonic (63%) acids, and it raised palmitic (30%) and linoleic (2.3-fold) acids. Neither OBD nor WED modified the composition of fatty acids in phospholipids of lymphocytes. In contrast, both diets had a marked effect on composition of fatty acids in macrophage phospholipids. OBD raised the proportion of myristic (42%) and linoleic (2.4-fold) acids and decreased that of lauric (31%), palmitoleic (43%), and arachidonic (29%) acids, WED increased palmitic (18%) and stearic (23%) acids and lowered palmitoleic (35%) and arachidonic (78%) acids. Of both cells, macrophages were more responsive to the effect of the fiber-rich diets on fatty acid composition of phospholipids. The high turnover of fatty acids in macrophage membranes may explain the differences between both cells. The modifications observed due to the effects of both diets were similar in few cases: an increase in palmitic and linoleic acids of total neutral lipids occurred and a decrease in palmitoleic and arachidonic acids of phospholipid. Therefore, the mechanism involved in the effect of both diets might be different.",1215,1,0,1,-1,0,2,1,2,0,258

"A collaborative study was conducted involving 8 laboratories (including the authors' laboratories) to validate the streamlined enzymatic method for determination of beta-D-glucan in barley and oats. In the method, the flour sample is cooked to hydrate and gelatinize beta-glucan, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to soluble fragments with the lichenase enzyme. After volume and pH adjustments and filtration, the solution is treated with beta-glucosidase, which hydrolyzes beta-gluco-oligosaccharides to D-glucose. D-Glucose is measured with glucose oxidase-peroxidase reagent. Other portions of lichenase hydrolysate are treated directly with glucose oxidase-peroxidase reagent to measure free glucose in test sample. If levels of free glucose are high, the sample is extracted first with 80% ethanol. For all samples analyzed, the repeatability relative standard deviation (RSDr) values ranged from 3.1 to 12.3% and the reproducibility relative standard deviation (RSDR) values ranged from 6.6 to 12.3%.

"Heat treatment of oat grain had significant effects on the viscosity of flour slurries. Steamed oats produced highly viscous flour slurries, whose viscosity increased with time, whereas the viscosity of hour slurries produced from raw or roasted (104 degrees C for 120 min) oats was much lower and degraded rapidly. Slurry viscosity was correlated with (1 --> 3), (1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucan concentration in the flours and treatment of slurries with lichinase lowered viscosity significantly. Effects of steaming were partially reversed by roasting treatment and vice versa. Mixtures of equal amounts of raw and steamed flour resulted in slurries more viscous than either flour alone, but that viscosity degraded after 3 h to less than the mean viscosity of the steamed and raw controls. Water-soluble extracts from steamed flour had about twice the viscosity of raw or roasted flour extracts, but contained only 80% of the (1 --> 3), (1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucan present in those extracts. Molecular weight analysis of soluble carbohydrates from raw, roasted and steamed soluble extracts indicated the molecular weight of beta-glucans in these extracts was similar. However, if extracts were made from slurries that had incubated for 3 h, extensive degradation of beta-glucans was evident in raw and roasted samples. It is likely that enzymic degradation of (1 --> 3),(1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucans is responsible for much of the decreased raw and roasted flour slurry viscosity over extended time periods, but different heat treatments appear to also affect (1 --> 3), (1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucan polymer interaction.",1218,99,99,99,0,0,0,0,2,3,248

"The effects of fat level (5, 12 and 30%), carrageenan and oat fibre on the hydration/binding properties, colour and flavour characteristics of frankfurters were investigated. Decreasing the fat content from 30% to 5% significantly increased cook loss and decreased water holding capacity and emulsion stability. Reduced-fat products were also darker and redder compared with the 30% fat controls. Addition of carrageenan or oat fibre reduced cook loss and increased both water holding capacity and emulsion stability. Sensory evaluation indicated that decreasing fat from 30% to 5% increased the intensity of smokiness, spiciness and saltiness and reduced the overall acceptability of the flavour. Carrageenan or oat fibre did not alter the colour of the frankfurters and neither ingredient had a significant effect on the flavour characteristics assessed. The results demonstrate that carrageenan or oat fibre can partially offset some of the changes which occur in low-fat frankfurters when added water replaces fat and protein level is constant.

"Objective: An active hypolipidemic component in oats, the soluble fiber beta-glucan, has been concentrated in an oat fiber extract. The oat fiber extract has been used to replace fat in food products. This study was designed to determine if moderate levels of oat fiber extract could be incorporated into a typical diet and whether plasma lipids could be reduced by the amount of beta-glucan added to the diet. Methods: Oat fiber extracts containing low (1% by weight) or high (10% by weight) beta-glucan were fed to 23 mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects (seven men and 16 women). A maintenance diet was fed for 1 week followed by diets containing an oat extract for 5 weeks each in a crossover pattern. Five percent of the energy from fat in the maintenance diet was replaced with the oat extract in the experimental diets. Caloric intake was adjusted to try to maintain each subject's initial weight. Fasting blood was collected several days apart after separate 12 hour fasts the end of each period. Plasma was analyzed for triglycerides, total cholesterol, and Lipoprotein cholesterol fractions. Results: HDL, HDL(2), and VLDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels after the oat extract diets were not significantly different from those after the maintenance diet. Total and LDL cholesterol levels decreased significantly (p < 0.001) from maintenance levels after both diets containing the oat extracts. Total cholesterol levels after the higher beta-glucan extract diet were significantly lower than those after the low beta-glucan diet. Conclusions: Beneficial reduction of cholesterol was obtained with modest amounts of oat extract incorporated into the diet. A significant dose response due to beta-glucan concentration in the oat extract was observed in total cholesterol levels.",1221,1,1,-1,99,1,3,1,0,1,277
"This study compares the response of old and modern oat (Avena sativa L.) lines to pre-anthesis precipitation in long-term field trials, and to pre-and post-anthesis drought in the greenhouse. Longterm field trials were carried out at the Experimental Farms of Hankkija Plant Breeding Institute and the University of Helsinki between 1965 and 1988. Grain yield of 12 oat lines (released since 1959) was compared with that of the check lines. The effect of differences in May-June precipitation on grain yield was established for different lines. Greenhouse experiments included 19 oat lines (released since 1921) and three wild species of oat (A. barbata L., A. sterilis max. L. and A. fatua L.). The data from greenhouse experiments were analysed using discriminant analysis in groups of old (released before 1970s), modern, and wild oat types. Ranking of the oat lines according to results from long-term field trials and greenhouse experiments was not consistent; contrary to the field experiments, the old lines tended to be the most drought sensitive when tested in the greenhouse.

"Whole grains of different cereals have traditionally been prepared with water and heat prior to dehulling, but knowledge of the effect on nutritional properties is limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate if phytate reduction occurred during hydrothermal treatment of whole grains. Wheat, rye, hulled and dehulled barley, hulled oats and naked oats were incubated with either water or acetate buffer (pH 4.8) at 55 degrees C for 24h with the exception of oats, which were incubated at 37 degrees C. Phytate in wheat, rye and barley was reduced by 46-77 % when water was used and by 84-99 % when acetate buffer was used. The phytate reduction in oats was considerably less, 8-26 %, but, after grinding and soaking, phytate was reduced by 72-77 % in dehulled oats and by 88-91% in naked oats. Citric acid and citrate buffer was used for pH adjustment in some experiments, and their use resulted in less phytate reduction than when acetate and lactic acid were used. Wet-steeping of naked oats and naked barley in water al 53-57 degrees C for 20-30 min reduced the bacterial counts by 99.97 %, and the addition of acid prevented bacterial growth during the incubations. It was concluded that cereals with reduced phytate content and good hygienic quality can be developed and produced using hydrothermal treatment of whole grains.

"Physico-chemical properties and the digestibility of carbohydrates (starch, beta-glucan and arabinoxylan (AX)) were studied in the gastrointestinal contents of pigs fed diets based on oat bran. One diet was made of commercially prepared oat bran and another of oat bran milled to pass a 1 mm screen. The pigs were slaughtered and samples were collected quantitatively from 10 sites of the gastrointestinal tract either 1 or 3 h after the morning feeding. The viscosity of the liquid phase (obtained by centrifugation) of the stomach and small intestinal contents varied greatly between animals, and was not significantly different between segments of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The molecular weight of beta-glucan was reduced up to 20-fold in the upper gastrointestinal tract but was of a relatively low digestibility until the terminal ileum. The solubility (the fraction of the total content in the liquid phase of digesta after centrifugation) of beta-glucan varied from 0.25 to 0.58 in the stomach and small intestine, whereas the solubility of AX was in the range of 0.04-0.16. Microscopic examination of digesta showed that beta-glucan was retained in intact endospermic cell wall structures, which remained evident until the distal small intestine but was completely disrupted in the caecum.

"Insoluble fiber fractions from raw and extruded oat, rice and wheat brans were isolated and phytate removed. in vitro mineral binding studies were performed utilizing copper (Cu2+), calcium (Ca2+) and zinc (Zn2+) ions, which were added individually to enzymatically treated (Prosky et al., 1985), acid washed insoluble fiber residues from oat, rice and wheat brans. The enzymatic digestion step with alpha-amylase, protease and amyloglucosidase served to remove protein and starch from the samples. Mineral binding studies were performed on the insoluble fiber residue. Mineral content was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Raw brans served as controls. A twin-screw extruder Model DNDG-62/20D, manufactured by Buhlerag (CH-9240, Uzwil, Switzerland) was utilized. The objectives of the study were to determine the total Cu2+, Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding capacity of the dephytinized insoluble fiber from each bran; and to determine if extrusion screw speed affected the brans' insoluble fiber mineral binding capacity. Although dephytinized, the brans' insoluble fiber fraction bound Cu2+, Ca2+ and Zn2+ ions. Oat bran bound more Cu2+, Ca2+ and Zn2+ than wheat bran, which bound more than rice bran.

"We compared the effects of a diet in which approximate to 25% of the carbohydrate was replaced by high-amylose starch with those of a similar diet high in oat bran or low-amylose starch in 23 hypertriglyceridemic subjects who were overweight mostly because of abdominal adiposity. Each diet was consumed for 4 wk in random order and in a crossover fashion. Overall, the diets were high in carbohydrate (> 55% of energy) and low in fat (< 30% of energy); the amount of resistant starch in the foods containing high-amylose starch was 17 g in women and 25 g in men. The metabolic effects of specific starches on plasma lipids, fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin profiles, and bowel function were assessed at the end of each intervention. Plasma triacylglycerols (triglycerides) were significantly lower after the oat bran diet than after the other two diets (P < 0.02). No other effects on fasting plasma lipids, glucose, or insulin were noted. However, when the high-amylose starch comprised 33% of the carbohydrate content in a test meal, there was a significant but biologically small reduction in the overall postprandial plasma insulin concentration by 17% relative to the low-amylose diet (P < 0.01). Both the oat bran and the high-amylose diet resulted in an increased frequency of bowel actions and lower fecal pH (P < 0.02) relative to the low-amylose diet. However, unlike the oat bran diet, the high-amylose diet increased short-chain fatty acid concentrations in fecal water by 32% (P < 0.001).",1229,1,1,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,249
"Nutrients not absorbed in the small bowel will form substrates for microbial growth in the colon which may have implications for the development of colon cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether fibre-rich oat and barley diets increase the excretion of energy-supplying nutrients from the small bowel compared with a low-fibre wheat diet, and whether a possible increase could be related to the beta-glucan content. Nine ileostomy subjects were served four types of bread together with a low-fibre basal diet (12 g dietary fibre/d). The breads were based on either wheat flour (W diet, 7 g dietary fibre/d), oat bran (OB diet, 29 g dietary fibre/d), the same amount of oat bran with addition of beta-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) (OBE diet, 19 g dietary fibre/d) or a fibre-rich barley fraction (B diet, 35 g dietary fibre/d). An increased ileal excretion of starch was observed with the barley diet but no effect of the oat beta-glucan on starch recovery was found. The NSP + Klason lignin in the ileostomy effluents accounted only for 24, 31, 24 and 35% of the gross energy excretion in the W, OB, OBE and B diet periods respectively. A large part of the dry weight and energy (30, 21, 28 and 27%, in the W, OB, OBE and B diets respectively) in the effluents could not be identified as fat, protein, total starch or NSP + Klason lignin.

"The absorption of Zn or Fe from breakfast meals containing oat porridge prepared from malted and soaked oats and a control porridge made from untreated oats was measured in human subjects. The effect on Zn and Fe absorption of reducing the phytate content of oat-porridge meals was examined in each subject by extrinsic labelling of porridge with Zn-65 and of bread rolls with Fe-55 and Fe-59, and measuring whole-body retention and the erythrocyte uptake of isotopes. Each experiment comprised nine to ten subjects. The absorption of Zn from malted-oat porridge with a phytate (inositol hexaphosphate) content of 107 mu mol was 18.3%, and significantly higher (P < 0.05) than from the control porridge containing 432 mu mol phytate (11.8%). Pe absorption from the meal containing malted-oat porridge with 107 mu mol phytate (Expt 2) was also significantly improved (P < 0.05) compared with that from the meal containing control porridge with 437 mu mol phytate. The average increase in Fe absorption was 47%, or from 4.4 to 6.0%. In the breakfast meal containing malted porridge with 198 mu mol phytate (Expt 3) the increase in Fe absorption was not significantly improved. Even though the phytate content was reduced to a greater extent in Expt 3 than Expt 2, the average increase in Fe absorption in Expt 3 was only 25% more than that from the meal containing control porridge (with 599 mu mol phytate), depending on the higher absolute amount of phytate.

The oat grains were of three varieties (Kapp, Mustang and Svea), stored at different relative humidities (30, 55 or 80%) For 3.5 or 15.5 months and heat-treated either with or without prior dehulling. The main differences in sensory attributes were related to the various thermal processes. Processed dehulled samples, particularly of the Mustang variety, had the highest intensities of oat odour, oat flavour, fresh odour and fresh flavour. Samples processed with hulls, in particular the varieties Kapp and Svea had the highest intensities of odour and flavour, rancid odour and flavour and bitterness. The sensory profile of processed oats were described partly by variations in phenolic compounds of low molecular weight, fat acidity and moisture content after processing. Twenty-nine per cent of the variation in odour and flavour attributes was explained by the 11 phenolic compounds analysed. Water content and the phenolic compounds p-coumaric acid, vanillin, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol were significantly correlated (P<0.05) to high levels of rancidity, flavour intensity and bitterness and low levels of freshness, oat odour and flavour. The avenanthramides were related mainly to low levels of flavour intensity and rancid odour and flavour. Caffeic acid and fat acidity were related to low intensities of sweetness and aftertaste.

"Dairy cows in early or mid-lactation were offered naked oats- or barley-based concentrates in addition to ad libitum access to grass silage in a continuous design experiment of 10 weeks duration. Concentrates were formulated on an isonitrogenous basis and contained either 500 g barley or 565 g naked oats kg(-1) concentrates as the principal energy source in the concentrate. Concentrate type had no effect on silage intake, milk yield or milk protein concentration. However, nitrogen and modified acid detergent fibre digestibility were significantly reduced by inclusion of naked oats and this was reflected in a significant reduction in milk fat concentration. Milk fat from early lactation cows on the naked oats diet contained the highest proportion of unsaturated and the lowest proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sensory and instrumental analyses determined that this milk fat produced the softest, most spreadable butter. This was supported by solid fat content results. The degree of change in milk fat composition due to diet was similar irrespective of stage of lactation but milk fat compositions with the control treatment differed with stage of lactation. Dietary effects were established by the end of the first week of the trial and persisted for the 10-week trial period.",1236,99,1,-1,1,99,2,1,0,2,201
"The storage stability of oat flours (Avena sativa L.) was investigated by sensory and chemical methods. Raw and heat-treated flour samples of three cultivars of oats (Kapp, Mustang, and Svea) were stored at 23 degrees C and 50% relative humidity for 0, 5, 18, and 42 weeks before analyses. Descriptive sensory analysis and analyses of total fatty acids (FA), free fatty acids (FFA) and volatile lipid oxidation products were performed after each storage period. Storage of raw flours for five weeks resulted in 66% FFA but stable levels of flavors and volatile compounds. After 18 weeks, the level of volatiles and FFA was higher, while the samples at 42 weeks had an intense paint flavor, high levels of several volatiles, and reduced levels of FA and FFA. The major volatiles in stored oat flours were hexanal and 2-pentyl-furan. The other carbonyls were mainly aldehydes. For raw oat flours, most correlation coefficients between volatiles and the attributes of paint odor, paint flavor, odor intensity, and flavor intensity were > 0.90. The volatiles were negatively correlated to oat odor and flavor and sweetness (r = -0.80 to -0.90). Heat-treatment of oat flours reduced the levels of FA, FFA, and most flavors, particularly bitterness and astringency. The levels of hexanal and oat flavor increased, while most volatiles remained constant. Stability against lipid oxidation was greatly increased by heat treatment. The levels of volatiles in heat-treated samples were less well correlated to flavors. Thus, differently heat-treated samples should be assessed separately in future flavor prediction models.",1237,1,99,-1,99,99,1,1,0,3,252
"Granular oat starch was subjected to hydrolysis with Bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase in either calcium acetate or sodium acetate buffer and compared with the hydrolysis of waxy-maize starch granules. The enzyme was pumped through a thin layer of starch packed into a special column and further into an ion-exchanger that retained the enzyme but not the dextrins solubilised from the granules. Both the amylose and the amylopectin components of oat starch granules were attacked by the enzyme. Calcium ions increased the rate of solubilisation of the oat starch granules but not of the waxy-maize starch granules. However, the composition of the solubilised dextrins was clearly affected with both types of granules so that the molecular weight distribution of the products shifted to smaller sizes in the presence of calcium. Other salts that were tested with the oat starch granules did not affect the solubilisation rate. Scanning electron micrographs showed that the attack pattern of alpha-amylase on oat starch is different from the attack on waxy-maize granules.

"The influence of dietary fibre on the biological effects of glucosinolates was investigated in gnotobiotic rats harbouring a human whole faecal flora. Animals were fed for 6 wk with diets containing 12% rapeseed meal (RSM) supplemented or not supplemented with 10% inulin (INL) or oat fibre. Both fibre types enhanced the liver hypertrophy due to RSM to equal extents, but had different effects on the other glucosinolate-related toxic effects. INL partially restored a normal thyroid hormone status whereas kidney weight, goitre and growth deficit wt:re increased on exposure to the diet containing oat fibre. Oat fibre and, to a lesser extent, INL modulated the alterations of digestive xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XME) induced by RSM. They counter-balanced the induction of hepatic cytochrome P-450 and lessened the induction of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase in the liver but did not modify depletion of its activity in the small intestine. On the other hand, they enhanced the induction of glutathione S-transferase in the liver and the large intestine but not in the small intestine. These findings give new evidence that the biological effects of naturally occurring non-nutrient compounds are closely dependent on the composition of the diet. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain the different influence of INL and oat fibre on RSM toxicity. Their different fermentative characteristics could lead to a modulation of the bacterial metabolism of glucosinolates in the caecum. Alternatively, their own action on the digestive XME could modify the subsequent metabolism of bacterial glucosinolate derivatives.

"Wheat bran (WB), rice bran (RB), and oat fiber (OF) were analyzed for their proximate constituents and mineral content and evaluated for their binding capacity for calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn). Protein, soluble and insoluble dietary fiber, and endogenous mineral contents varied significantly among the three dietary fiber sources. With the exception of Mg, in higher concentration in RB, WB contained significantly (P < 0.05) more endogenous Ca, Cu, and Zn than RB or OF. Overall, WB bound significantly more Ca and Mg (alone or combined with other minerals) than RB and OF, respectively. OF bound more Cu than RB or WB. Zn (alone or in the presence of other minerals) was bound more strongly in WB and RB than OF. Re-acid washing stripped most of the bound minerals from the dietary fiber sources.",1240,1,-1,0,0,99,1,1,2,1,138
"The changes in plasma insulin, enterostatin, lipid, and glucose levels during weight reduction were studied in 32 subjects having a body mass index of 25-35. The 31 subjects who completed the study followed for 23 weeks an energy-restricted dietary regimen which included a new oat-based soup as the main meal once or twice daily. The intake of energy decreased from 8.9 to 6.2 MJ/day from 0 to 22 weeks, the energy percentage from fat decreased from 35 to 30%, and the intake of dietary fiber increased from 21 to 25 g/10 MJ. The body weight decreased from 83 to 78 kg after 6 weeks and to 77 kg after 23 weeks. Plasma glucose had decreased significantly from 5.4 to 5.2 mmol/l, and plasma insulin from 122 to 98 pmol/l after 23 weeks. In contrast, the plasma enterostatin concentration did not vary significantly over five sampling times, the mean values ranging from 25 to 30 nmol/l. Plasma cholesterol declined from 5.6 to 5.2 mmol/l, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from 3.8 to 3.3, and plasma triglycerides from 1.5 to 1.3 mmol/l from 0 to 23 weeks. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased from 1.1 to 1.3 mmol/l. It is concluded that an energy-restricted regimen leading to lower plasma insulin, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not significantly affect the plasma enterostatin concentration in overweight subjects. A new oat-based liquid food as a part of the dietary regimen was well tolerated.",1242,1,99,0,1,1,3,0,1,1,236
"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oat saponins (avenacosides A and B) have any effect on the permeability of the rat intestine to actively and passively transported markers in vitro and in vivo. Intestinal segments were mounted in modified Ussing chambers, and the passage of the different marker compounds from the mucosal to the serosal side was measured for 120 min. Avenacosides (1 mg/ml) gave a significantly higher passage of the macromolecule ovalbumin and there was a tendency to increased passage of [C-14]D-mannitol and [Cr-51]EDTA. On the other hand, the saponins did not affect the active transport of [H-3]methyl glucose. When rats were given saponins (40 mg/kg body weight) together with markers by gastric intubation, the passage of [Cr-51]EDTA into blood and urine was somewhat reduced. For the macromolecule bovine serum albumin, no evident effect on the passage was observed in the presence of saponins. Thus, in contrast to the in vitro results, the in vivo marker passage seemed to be unaffected or even reduced in the presence of avenacosides. The study shows that saponins can affect the permeability of the rat intestine. However, this effect needs further investigation in vivo, especially regarding proteins.",1243,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,4,0,198
"This study evaluated the generally accepted concept that dietary fiber from oat bran would have less effect on stool weight than wheat bran fiber. Nine healthy young men participated in two studies, each consisting of 28 days of a tow fiber diet and 28 days of a bran diet. Incorporation of 14-16 g of wheat bran or oat bran fiber into basal diets of 14-18 g of fiber increased wet and dry stool weights to the same extent and decreased fecal pH (P < 0.05). Neither bran changed stool moisture, gastrointestinal transit time, calcium balance, or defecation frequency. Most changes were first detected during the period from day 8 to days 12-14 of the study. Incorporation of oat bran only increased the propertion of soluble fiber in the diet from 24 to 33% of the total fiber. We conclude: 1) fiber in oat and wheat brans increases stool weight to the same extent; 2) some measures of bowel function may not change with added fiber if they are within the normal range during low fiber intakes; 3) wheat and oat brans do not adversely affect calcium balance when calcium intake is generous (greater than or equal to 1,200 mg/day); and 4) changes in bowel function may be detected by the second week of a dietary change if intake is rigorously controlled.",1244,1,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,0,221
"This study was designed to determine metabolic and physical performance responses to ingestion of pre-exercise meals with different macronutrient and fiber profiles. Twelve physically active subjects (6 males and 6 females) were used to investigate the metabolic and physical performance consequences of consuming pre-exercise meals consisting of oat, corn, or wheat cereals. A fasting trial served as the control, and all subjects received each treatment in a Latin-square design. Blood samples were drawn before and 85 min after meal ingestion, during 90 min of cycling exercise (60% VO2peak), after a 6.4 km performance ride, and during 60 min of recovery. Expired air samples were collected to determine nutrient utilization. Resting carbohydrate oxidation rates and plasma insulin concentrations after oat ingestion were less than after wheat, and corn and wheat ingestion, respectively (P < 0.05). During exercise, the change in plasma glucose from pre-exercise was greater after consuming wheat and corn compared with oat (P < 0.05), and it was inversely related to pre-exercise plasma insulin concentration (r = -0.55, P = 0.0001). Plasma free fatty acid concentrations were inversely related to plasma lactate concentrations (r = -0.58, P = 0.0001). Free Fatty acid concentrations and fat oxidation were greater in fasting trials than all others, but performance ride times did not differ among treatments. Plasma branched-chain amino acid concentrations resembled their respective meal profiles throughout exercise, the performance ride, and recovery. These results indicate that pre-exercise meal composition can influence glucose homeostasis during early exercise and plasma branched-chain amino acid concentrations over a substantial range of metabolic demands.",1245,0,0,1,1,99,2,0,2,1,258
"Four pigs fitted with a gastric cannula were fed on a wheat-flour-based diet (WF) and three oat-based diets, consisting mainly of oat flour (OF), rolled oats (RO) or oat bran (OB), for 1 week each, The stomach contents were collected quantitatively daily at 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 5 h after feeding, The viscosity (mPa.s) of the liquid fraction of stomach contents 1 h after feeding was 1.7 with diet WF, 15 with diet OF, 30 with diet RO and approximately 400 with diet OB. The viscosity and the concentration of beta-glucan in the liquid phase was to some extent determined by the dietary level of beta-glucan in the diet, However, there was a trend towards a lower viscosity after longer exposure to the gastric juices, The correlation between logarithmic values for viscosity and concentration of beta-glucan in the Liquid phase of digesta was r 0.45, On centrifugation of digesta there was a higher proportion present in the sediment phase when the pigs were fed on diets with a higher content of soluble dietary fibre (DF), suggesting that the digesta was more coherent, This possibility was supported by the higher water-holding capacity (WHC) of the sediment, Feeding diets with oats containing a higher soluble DF content led to lower recoveries of digesta, PEG 4000 (Liquid-phase marker), and the DF components beta-glucan and arabinoxylan in the first hour after feeding, No effect related to the DF content of the diet was seen in the gastric emptying of starch and Cr2O3 (solid-phase marker). In conclusion, soluble DF from oats increased the viscosity of stomach contents and increased the ability of the dry matter to retain water, Higher levels of soluble DF led to higher recoveries of digesta, the liquid phase and DF itself in the initial stage of gastric emptying, whereas no effect was seen on the gastric emptying of starch.",1246,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,309
"A comparison was made between the structure and physicochemical properties of starches extracted from five normal and one naked cultivar of oat. There was little difference in the molecular size or polydispersity of the native amylose and amylopectin determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), or in the unit chain distribution of isoamylase-debranched amylopectin, where three peaks were resolved at modal degree of polymerization of 15, 23, and 46. Apparent, total, and Delta-amylose (difference between apparent and total amylose due to lipid complexing) contents ranged from 19.7 to 22.0%, 27.5 to 29.8%, and 7.1. to 8.1, respectively, with lipid content, as fatty acid methyl esters, ranging from 0.66 to 0.75% on a dry basis and comprising the following fatty acids: 46.6% C16; 2.1% C18; 15.0% C18:1; 35.3% C18:2, and 0.7% C18:3. The naked oat starch had the lowest lipid content and Delta-amylose. Lintner type solubilization in 2M HCl (six days of incubation at 35 degrees C) ranged from 56.6 to 60.0% of the original dry alpha-glucan. The 80 degrees C swelling factor corresponding to postgelatinization swelling (determined by a blue dextran dye exclusion method) ranged from 8.6 to 10, with the naked oat being at the top of the range. At this temperature, the amount of alpha-glucan leached from the granules ranged from 4.1 to 6.6% (dry basis), where the highest value corresponded to the naked oat. Amylose (determined colorimetrically) accounted for 42.1-47.6% of the alpha-glucan in the leachate. No intermediate material could be detected by GPC. Damaged starch levels were very low in the starches analyzed (1.9-2.2% on a dr) basis). The high proportion of branched alpha-glucan in the leachate was confirmed by GPC and was attributed to the fragile nature of the gelatinized oat starch granules. Gelatinization parameters by differential scanning calorimetry were 44.7-47.3, 56.2-59.5, and 68.7-73.7 degrees C for T-o, T-p and T-c respectively, with Delta H ranging from 8.1 to 9.5 J/g.

"Postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses to cereal products made from common barley, oats or a barley genotype containing elevated levels of beta-glucans were evaluated in nine healthy subjects, Porridges were made from commercial Swedish wholemeal barley or oat flours, and a mixed whole-meal porridge using the high fiber barley genotype and commercial Swedish common barley (50:50). Also studied were two types of flour-based bread products composed of high fiber barley and common barley in ratios of 50: 50 or 80:20, respectively. The common oat and barley porridges produced postprandial glucose and insulin responses similar to the white wheat bread reference, suggesting that the naturally occurring dietary fiber in these whole-meal flours has no impact on the glucose tolerance. In contrast, all high fiber barley products induced significantly lower responses than did the reference product, with the glycemic and insulin indices ranging from 57 to 72 or 42 to 72%, respectively. It is concluded that ''lente'' products of high sensory quality can be prepared from a barley genotype with an elevated content of soluble dietary fiber. The glycemic index of these products compares favorably with that of products made from common cereals, suggesting their use as a potential component of diets for patients with diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and for individuals predisposed to metabolic disease.",1248,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,214
"A severe disease occurred in the field plots of naked (cv. Salomon), dwarf (cv. Pal), and conventional oat (cvs. Jalostettu maatiainen and Sale) at the Viikki Experimental Farm of the University of Helsinki, Finland, in 1994 and 1995. Symptoms were expressed as grayish-brown necrotic areas on the lower leaves which killed plants from the seedling to heading stage, the effect being cultivar dependent. The proportion of plants killed contributed to the yield losses. The infection also resulted in less grains per panicle and lower weight of both panicle and vegetative above-ground biomass. From a total of 57 fungal isolates obtained from infected leaves, Fusarium culmorum (W.G.Sm.) Sacc, and F. sambucinum Fuck. dominated and subsequently caused infection (particularly foot and root rot) in oat in laboratory tests. These two Fusarium spp. were considered to be the primary causal agents of the symptoms observed in the field, although other pathogens may have been present. The disease was probably soil-borne. The results of this study suggested that the unusually dry and warm weather during late June and in July was the principal factor behind the severe disease outbreak.",1249,99,99,-1,99,99,0,1,0,4,185
"Different processing technologies were examined for their efficiency in production of large amounts of good quality oat gum rich in (1-->3)(1-->4)-beta-D-glucan. Untreated and enzyme-deactivated oat bran concentrate were extracted with aqueous sodium carbonate at pH 10 and 40 degrees C. Oat gums were subsequently isolated either by dialysis, ultrafiltration, or alcoholic precipitation on small, medium, and pilot plant scales. It was possible to produce oat gums with a beta-glucan content of approximate to 60-65% with all three methodologies. The viscosity of solutions of the gums and the molecular weights differed, depending on the production process. Using dialysis, the production of highly viscous gums was possible, whereas ultrafiltration and alcoholic precipitation yielded gums with lower solution viscosity. Enzyme-deactivated oat bran concentrate gave an oat gum with an increased beta-glucan content and solution viscosity, but in lower yield. To produce large amounts of oat gum, alcoholic precipitation would be the process of choice, but ultrafiltration and dialysis are useful alternatives.",1250,0,99,-1,-1,1,1,2,1,1,158
"Starches from AC Stewart (Avena sativa L.) and NO 753-2 (Avena nuda L.) oat grains were isolated and some of the characteristics determined. The total starch lipids extracted by acid hydrolysis were 1.64% in both starches. The free lipid content (extracted by chloroform-methanol 2:1 v/v at 25 degrees C) was 21.3% and 18.0%, respectively, in NO 753-2 and AC Stewart starches. The free and bound lipid content (extracted by hot n-propanol-water 3:1 v/v from the residue left after chloroform-methanol extraction) was 77.4% and 82.0%, respectively, in NO 753-2 and AC Stewart starches. The total amylose content was nearly the same (similar to 23%) in both starches, of which 9.3% (NO 753-2) and 10.8% (AC Stewart) were complexed by native lipids. The starches differed widely in the extent of amylose leaching, degree of swelling, gelatinization transition temperatures and enthalpy, susceptibility towards acid and enzyme hydrolysis, gel strength, paste viscosity, thermal stability and retrogradation characteristics. The results showed that the extent of interaction of starch chains within the amorphous and crystalline regions of the granule was stronger in NO 753-2 than in AC Stewart.

"The thermal and retrogradation properties of oar starches from two cultivars (NO 753-2 and AC Stewart) were characterized in the presence of glucose, fructose and sucrose at a concentration of 36% w/v. In both oar starches, amylose leaching (AML) and swelling factor (SF) decreased in the presence of sugars (sucrose > glucose > fructose). These decreases were more pronounced in AC Stewart starch. The decrease in AML showed that sugars interact with amylose chains within the amorphous regions of the starch granule. The gelatinization transition temperature and the enthalpy of gelatinization increased in the presence of sugars (sucrose > glucose > fructose), The above increase was also more pronounced in AC Stewart starch. The decrease in SF and the increase in gelatinization parameters indicated that these changes were influenced by the interplay of factors such as starch-sugar interaction, changes in water structure in the presence of sugars, and the antiplastizing properties of sugars relative to water. The retrogradation enthalpy and the X-ray diffraction intensities of NO 753-2 and AC Stewart starch gels (stored at 4C) increased in the presence of sugars (glucose > fructose > sucrose). These changes were more pronounced in NO 753-2 starch.

"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether oat beta-glucan is responsible for the increased bile acid excretion previously observed with oat-fiber diets. The excretion patterns in ileostomy subjects given diets containing oat-bran bread with and without added beta-glucanase, a beta-glucan-degrading enzyme, were compared. The effect of a beta-glucan-rich barley fraction on sterol excretion was also investigated. Nine ileostomy subjects were served four diets in random order, each diet for 2 consecutive days. Four different kinds of bread, mainly made from oat bran (OB diet, 12.5 g beta-glucanid), oat bran with beta-glucanase (OBE diet, 3.8 g beta-glucan/d), barley (B diet, 13.0 g beta-glucan/d), or wheat flour (W diet, 1.2 g beta-glucan/d) were added to a basal diet. The 24-h excretion of bile acids was 53% higher in the OB diet period than in the OBE diet period (P < 0.05) and also was significantly higher than in the B and W diet periods (P < 0.05). Median (range) bile acid excretion was 851 (232-1550), 463 (123-1414), 755 (133-1187), and 606 (101-980) mg/d in the OB, OBE, B, and W diet periods, respectively. The excretion of cholesterol was significantly higher in the B diet period than in the OBE and W diet periods (P < 0.05), but the mechanism behind this effect of barley fiber is unknown. In oat bran, however, beta-glucan mediates an increase in bile acid excretion, which most probably explains the effect of oat fiber in lowering serum lipids.",1254,99,-1,0,1,-1,1,2,1,1,242

"A formula has previously been developed for an oat-based nutrient solution, fermented by Lactobacillus plantarum strain 299 V, to be used as a probiotica for people with a damaged intestinal microflora. Oats are nutritious and rich in minerals, but also contain large amounts of phytate (myoinositol hexaphosphate), which is one of the main inhibitors of absorption of iron and zinc in humans. The effects of phytases of varied sources (malted barley flour, malted oat flour, rye sour dough and of wheat phytase and phytase from Asperigillus niger), on the phytate degradation, acidity, bacterial counts and aroma of the oat-based nutrient solution were studied. The degradation of phytate varied between 100% and 72% of the initial value, depending on the source of phytase added. Malted barley flour and malted oat flour had the same capacity for degrading phytate in oats. The rate of pH decrease, final pH values, acidity, and viable counts of lactic acid bacteria varied in the solutions depending on the source of phytase. The most efficient phytate degradation was achieved by adding phytase from A. niger to the oat-based nutrient solution. However, by using the enzyme, the nutrient solution became bitter tasting and had low counts of lactic acid bacteria. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited",1256,1,99,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,207
"The effect of hydrothermal, Termamyl alpha-amylase, and Finase S40 phytase treatments on viscous behavior of dry- and wet-milled oat brans was studied. Regular oat bran from a dry-milling procedure was higher in starch and lower in beta-glucan and other dietary fibers than the fiber-concentrated oat bran from a wet-milling procedure. The high content of dietary fibers, especially beta-glucan, in the wet-milled oat bran had a marked effect on the viscosity of heat- and alpha-amylase-treated bran slurries. Heating increased the amount of soluble beta-glucan, on average, from 29 to 84%. The molecular weight of beta-glucan was 8.4 x 10(5) in regular oat bran and 6.0 x 10(5) in fiber-concentrated oat bran, and it remained unchanged during the hydrothermal and alpha-amylase treatments. The phytase preparation used for hydrolysis of phytic acid also caused a reduction in viscosity of oat bran slurries. When the phytase preparation was added before heating, the viscosity of bran slurries remained at low levels during the whole temperature cycle, owing mainly to degradation of beta-glucan. Rapid reduction in viscosity in the postheating treatments with phytase preparation was caused by the degradation of gelatinized starch together with beta-glucan. During both treatments with phytase preparation, the amount of soluble beta-glucan increased to 90%. Phytic acid content in the bran slurries decreased more (54%) in the postheating treatment than in the preheating treatment with Finase S40 phytase (36%). Enzymic studies showed that, at high levels of nonstarch polysaccharides, the viscosity of oat bran slurries changes only a little when starch is completely degraded to water-soluble oligosaccharides; but the viscosity clearly decreases when beta-glucan is only partially hydrolyzed to high molecular weight products (M(w) 4.0 x 10(4)).",1257,1,1,99,-1,0,2,1,1,1,275
"To test the hypothesis that the composition of oat endosperm cell walls would vary with the total great beta-glucan content, endosperm walls were isolated from two cultivars of oats previously identified as containing high and low levels of beta-glucan (Marion and OA516-2, respectively). Oat endosperm cell walls were isolated by a modification of a method developed for wheat endosperm walls. In this modification, a slurry of anion exchange resin beads was used to take out cell walls from the bran (aleurone, pericarp, and testa) that were not removed using the original procedure, and cytoplasmic starch and protein were removed by ''washing'' the cell walls with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in 70% ethanol. In both cultivars, beta-glucan was the major endospermic cell wall polysaccharide, constituting approximately 85% of the wall. Despite the major difference in the beta-glucan content of the two cultivars, determined on a great basis, this difference was not reflected in the composition of isolated endosperm walls. The beta-glucan content and monosaccharide composition were similar for the two types of walls. There were, however, differences in the phenolic acid content of the walls between the two cultivars, with those from OA516-2 having a higher total phenolic acid content than those from Marion. Preliminary analyses indicate that oat endosperm cell walls are composed primarily of beta-glucan and arabinoxylan, with a small amount of cellulose and glucomannan. Phenolic acids and a small amount of protein, determined as amino acids, are also present in the cell wall.",1261,0,1,0,99,1,2,0,2,1,245
"Isolated cell walls from two cultivars of oats, one with a high content of beta-glucan (Marion) and one with a low beta-glucan content (OA516-2), were fractionated in an attempt to understand the structure of the endosperm cell wall. Isolated walls were sequentially extracted with hot water (65 degrees C), digested with lichenase ([1-->3][1-->4]-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.73), and then digested with endoxylanase. The final residue after consecutive hot-water extraction and digestion by the two enzymes was acid hydrolyzed for analysis of the monosaccharide composition by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The whole wall composition, as well as the composition of the fractions generated during hot-water extraction and enzymatic dissociation, was similar for the two cultivars of oats. The fractionation characteristics of the walls were consistent with a layered model: a relatively thin outer layer, adjacent to the middle lamella, consisting of an insoluble polysaccharide skeleton (cellulose and glucomannan) plus matrix polysaccharides (beta-glucan and arabinoxylan), and a large inner layer of soluble polysaccharides (beta-glucan and arabinoxylan). These layers correspond to the residue after hot-water extraction and the hot-water extract, respectively.",1262,0,99,-1,99,99,0,1,1,3,177
"beta-Glucan was extracted with sodium hydroxide from one sample of hull-less barley (Azhul) bran and two samples of oat bran in the laboratory and from one sample of hull-less barley (Scout) bran in the pilot plant, and subsequently purified. The sodium hydroxide solvent extracted 96-98% of the beta-glucans from the four brans; beta-glucan recovery after purification varied from 73-77% in barley brans and 87-95% in oat brans. Azhul barley bran preparation contained 76% beta-glucan, 11% pentosans and about 1% protein, starch, ether extract, and ash; the preparations from oat brans contained 69-72% beta-glucan, 7-8% pentosans and less than 2% protein, starch, ether extract and ash. The pilot plant preparation from Scout barley bran contained only 50% beta-glucan and a high ash content (16%) due to poor washing of the extracted material; its protein, starch and ether extract contents were also higher. The apparent viscosity of the beta-glucans was highly concentration-dependent, the pilot plant preparation was the most viscous. The apparent molecular weight of the beta-glucans was estimated at 2 x 10(6). Calculation of power law constants of 1% beta-glucan solutions gave low consistency indices (<0.2 Pa x s) except for the pilot plant preparation (0.76 Pa x s), and a high flow behavior index (0.75-0.89). The latter values suggested low shear sensitivity of the preparations. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited",1263,99,99,99,0,99,0,0,1,4,220
"The study was conducted to determine if the excretion of starch and dietary fiber components varies in ileostomy subjects consuming diets high or low in dietary fiber. Excretion of starch, enzyme-resistant starch and dietary fiber components was studied in nine human subjects with ileostomies, who consumed (in a crossover design) a wheat bread-based diet (daily intake 274 g starch, 2.4 g enzyme-resistant starch and 14.4 g total dietary fiber) and a high fiber diet based on oat-bran bread (daily intake 243 g starch, 2.7 g enzyme-resistant starch and 40.2 g total dietary fiber). Food and excreta were collected on d 3 and 17. No significant differences in excretion of starch, enzyme-resistant starch or dietary fiber components were found on these 2 d in each dietary period. When subjects consumed the wheat bread-based diet they excreted (mean +/-SD) 3.3 +/- 1.7 g starch and 2.4 +/- 0.4 g enzyme-resistant starch daily, whereas when consuming the oat bran-based diet they excreted 4.5 +/- 3.1 g starch and 2.5 +/- 0.4 g enzyme-resistant starch. During both dietary periods subjects excreted significantly greater amounts of certain dietary fiber polysaccharide residues (fucose, galactose and uronic acid) than they ingested. This indicates a contribution of endogenous and/or microbial material to the dietary fiber value in ileostomy effluents. However, significantly less excretion of some dietary fiber polysaccharide residues, especially glucose residues, during the oat-bran bread-based dietary period was also noted. This was presumably caused by a degradation of mixed-linked (1,3),(1,4)-beta-D-glucans.",1264,0,0,0,-1,-1,0,2,3,0,243
"The effects of oat saponins (a mixture of avenacosides A and B) and dietary fibre (cellulose and guar gum) on the disaccharidase activities in the proximal small intestine of the rat were investigated. The influence of avenacosides A and B on the activity of disaccharidases and alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) was also studied in vitro. In vivo, oat diets with three avenacoside contents (negligible, normal and twice normal) were used. No significant differences in sucrase (EC 3.2.1.48), maltase (EC 3.2.1.20), trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28) and lactase (EC 3.2.1.21) activities were found between the oat groups after 19 d feeding. The rats that were given cellulose tended to have higher disaccharidase activities compared with the other groups. The avenacosides inhibited the lactase activity significantly in vitro while no or small effects on the other disaccharidases were found. In contrast, the in vitro hydrolysis of starch by alpha-amylase was increased in the presence of saponins, probably due to their detergent effect. Thus, the in vitro studies showed that the avenacosides could influence the enzyme activities. In vivo, these effects are probably minor due to the low avenacoside concentrations found in oats.",1265,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,187
"Objectives: The effect of consumption of a wheat-flour bread-based low-fibre diet (7.8g/day fibre; 1.0 portion) or the same diet in which the wheat bread was exchanged for a bread based on oat bran with a high fibre content (31.9 g/day fibre; 1.0 portion) on the ileal excretion of amino acid residues and crude protein was studied. Design: The study was performed as a cross-over design. Setting: The subjects were studied as outpatients except on the sampling days when all subjects were admitted to the research ward and stayed in a nearby patient hotel overnight. Subjects: Seven men and three women, all proctocolectomised for ulcerative colitis, volunteered to participate in the study. One female subject was withdrawn from the study because of inflammation of the ileal stoma. Interventions: During each dietary period of 3 weeks, food and excreta were collected and analysed on days 3 and 17. Results: No significant differences in excretion of crude protein or amino acids (free and bound) were found between the two sampling days. Intake as well as excretion of all analysed amino acids was higher during the high-fibre diet period, although the relative proportion of amino acids was comparable in the two diets and their corresponding ileal effluents. Aspartic acid, glycine, threonine, alanine and serine were found in considerably higher relative proportions in the effluents from the subjects when they consumed each of the two diets than their concentrations in the diets. The apparent digestibilities were significantly (P < 0.05) lower for all analysed amino acids during the high-fibre diet period. Aspartic acid (10.7%), alanine (9.9%) and glycine (8.5%) showed a more pronounced decrease than the mean decrease in amino acid digestibility (6.6%) when subjects consumed the high-fibre diet. Conclusion: Intake of the oat bran high-fibre diet resulted in significantly lower amino acid and crude protein digestibility.

"Oat bran porridges were cooked and fermented at 5, 10, 15, and 20% solids (as is basis). Cooking was carried out on gas stove and viscograph. Supplementation with malt flour at 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1%. Cooked oat bran porridge was inoculated with fresh yoghurt and fermented 18 h overnight in an incubator at 42 degrees C. Falling number values were made to estimate the effects of amylase treatments by addition of malt flour on oat bran slurry when heated in an aqueous suspension. Pasting properties were observed with the viscograph and consistency measurements were made with Bostwick consistometer. The falling number method was not suitable for consistency measurements due to wide variations in values obtained. Enzymatic additions reduced the consistency of porridge with an increase in flowability during measurements. The peak heights obtained from the viscograms reduced proportionally with an increase in malt flour supplementation. The desirability of a product with higher energy values and a sufficiently low consistency that is spoonable was possible with cooked, fermented oat bran porridge.",1267,99,99,1,99,1,2,0,0,3,172
"The rheological behavior of partially hydrolyzed oat (1-->3)(1-->4)beta-D-glucan was compared to that of the original unhydrolyzed P-D-glucan. Flow and oscillatory shear measurements of the nonhydrolyzed sample in aqueous solution showed behavior typical of noninteracting polysaccharides, such as guar gum, in solution. The theology of partially hydrolyzed samples shifted toward the more gel-like behavior observed with polymers, which tend to aggregate and form a three-dimensional macromolecular network. The aggregation may arise from a tendency of the beta-glucan to self-associate through cellulose-like sequences in the structure. However, the reason why this behavior was not observed with unhydrolyzed oat gum is not understood. It is unlikely that structural variations, such as the amount of cellulose-like sequences, accounted for the different theology, because quantitative analysis of oligosaccharides released by lichenase evidenced only minor differences between intact oat beta-glucan and hydrolyzed samples. A more likely explanation is that because of their lower molecular weight, the partially hydrolyzed molecules are more mobile and diffuse more easily. Hence, they have a greater probability of forming aggregates.",1268,0,0,0,0,99,0,0,4,1,169
"Objective: There is much evidence that oat products lower serum lipid concentrations in hypercholesterolaemic subjects. This effect has been attributed to the soluble fibre component of oat (1-->3)(1-->4)-beta-D-glucan. Therefore, the practical role of oat bran beta-glucan on serum lipid indices was examined. Design: A metabolically controlled, randomised, single-blind, cross-over study. Setting: Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Department of Food Science and University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. Subjects: 14 healthy young men, selected from university staff and students. Interventions: After a 1-week run-in period subjects were randomly assigned to a test group (oat gum instant whip, 9 g beta-glucan/day) or a control group (placebo instant whip) for 14 days. After completing the first diet, subjects switched to the other diet for 14 days. The study was strictly metabolically controlled. Blood samples were collected for measurement of serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations. Results: The dietary intake of the two groups was not significantly different. The body weights and physical activities of the subjects did not change significantly during the study. No statistically significant effect of the oat gum could be detected on serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. HDL cholesterol was significantly higher (P < 0.05) during the test period. Conclusions: The cholesterol-lowering capacity of oat gum in healthy young men is weak. The effect of oat bran preparations on serum cholesterol levels cannot be estimated by the beta-glucan content but by measurement of the solubility and viscosity of the beta-glucan.",1269,1,1,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,245
"Oat protein fractions were characterized by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Salt-soluble, alcohol-soluble, and alkali-soluble protein fractions were extracted with 1.0 M NaCl, 52% ethanol, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in 0.05 M borate buffer (pH 10), respectively. RP-HPLC analysis conditions were first optimized for column performance, concentration of ion-pairing reagent (trifluoroacetic acid [TFA]), protein reductive state, and elution temperature. These analysis conditions were used to characterize five Finnish oat cultivars (Puhti, Ryhti, Veli, Nasta, and Virma). In addition, effects of processing on oat protein composition were analyzed in high-protein oat flour and steamed oat goats derived from the oat starch process. Wet processing only slightly influenced RP-HPLC separation profiles of protein fractions. The greatest difference between high-protein oat flour and groats was the amount of salt-soluble components eluting during the first 15 min. Prolamin patterns of Puhti, Ryhti, and Virma clearly differentiate these cultivars. Prolamin patterns of cultivars Veli and Nasta were similar; half the genome in these cultivars is from the same parent. For all cultivars, RP-HPLC separations of salt- and alkali-soluble proteins were similar. However, quantities of some components differed, particularly those in the alkali-soluble fraction. RP-HPLC reproducibility was generally good, although replicate alcohol extractions revealed some components not consistently present. These were probably due to the extractant (52% ethanol). Other trials suggested that 70% ethanol may be a more reliable oat prolamin extractant for RP-HPLC analysis. These results emphasize the importance of thoroughly optimizing RP-HPLC analysis conditions for protein characterization.",1270,99,1,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,245
"Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) of endosperm storage proteins was used to differentiate cultivars of both oats and rice in less than 12 min. This is the first report that proteins of these two cereals have been separated by CZE. Cultivars were chosen for the difficulty of differentiating them by other means, electrophoretic or chromatographic. Ethanol (70%) extracts of the oat samples were separated on a 20-mum i.d. untreated fused-silica capillary, whereas rice samples were extracted with 60% 1-propanol, and the solubilized proteins were separated on a 50-mum i.d. untreated fused-silica capillary. The CZE separation buffer was 0.1 M phosphate, pH 2.5, containing 0.05% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). Most cultivars were differentiated quickly and easily. Only the patterns of two rice cultivars, IR36 and IR50, were nearly identical. There were no differences between IR36 and IR50 extracts by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or acid (A)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). CZE is a faster method of separating endosperm storage proteins than A-PAGE and separates as least as well and better in most cases than either A-PAGE or reversed phase (RP)-HPLC.",1271,99,1,0,1,99,2,0,1,2,175
"Oat bran was treated with endo-beta-D-glucanases to hydrolyze beta(1-->3) (1-->4)-glucans. Hydrolysis of beta-glucans reduced the in vitro viscosity of a suspension of oat bran. Untreated oat bran and hydrolyzed oat bran were incorporated into hypercholesterolemic purified diets and fed to rats for 4 wk; a diet containing cellulose was used as a control. Hepatic cholesterol accumulation was affected by dietary treatment and was less in the oat bran group than in the enzyme-treated oat bran or cellulose groups. Thus, functional properties of (1-->3) (1-->4)-beta-D-glucan, such as viscosity, appear to be related to its hypocholesterolemic potential.",1272,0,1,-1,0,99,1,1,2,1,95
"In order to study the cholesterol-lowering properties of oat bran-based ready-to-eat cereal (RTE), rats (12/group) were fed the following diets: basal semipurified (B), B plus 1% cholesterol (BC), BC plus 10% cellulose (fiber control), BC + 67% of an extruded RTE cereal; BC + 67% of a conventionally cooked RTE cereal; and BC + 67% of the raw ingredients of the latter. All the RTE cereal products were oat bran-based, and 1% cholesterol was included in the dietary formulations. Ar the end of a 3-week feeding period, serum total cholesterol was significantly increased from 2.02 +/- 0.13 mmol/L to 3.57 +/- 0.18 mmol/L due to cholesterol feeding alone. The presence of either cellulose or oat bran products in the diet negated the hypercholesterolemia. Inclusion of 1% cholesterol in the diet raised liver cholesterol almost 10 fold. All three of the oat bran-based products significantly inhibited the increase but cellulose was ineffective. Liver cholesterol content was due primarily to the accumulation of cholesteryl esters. Liver triglyceride was also increased by dietary cholesterol and the presence of cellulose or oat bran in the diet appeared to enhance this effect. The method of processing the RTE appears to affect the efficacy of oat bran.",1273,-1,1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,201
"Objective: Evaluate the importance of incomplete gelatinization, food structure and presence of viscous dietary fibre for the postprandial glycaemic and insulinaemic responses to oat and wheat products.

Boiled intact oat and wheat kernels (kernel porridges) were also included. For comparison, glycaemic indices (GIs) were calculated both from analysis of capillary and venous blood samples. Setting: The study was performed at the research laboratory, Dalby Health Sciences Centre (primary care). Subjects: Nine healthy male volunteers between 65 and 70 years of age participated in the study. Results: The rolled oats and oat porridge elicited high metabolic responses. No differences in the glycaemic and insulinaemic indices (IIs) were seen between these products and white wheat bread. In contrast, the kernel porridges produced low glucose and insulin responses. No differences were obtained in GI values whether based on capillary or venous blood. However, with some products capillary blood allowed smaller differences to be detected.

"Oat gum was extracted from oat bran and examined chromatographically for monosaccharide constituent, presence of glycoprotein and equivalent dextran molecular weight (EDMW).

Viscosity of oat gum was compared with that of other food grade gums (xanthan, guar, gum arabic, and locust bean). TLC analysis identified only glucose and showed no evidence of xylose, arabinose or glycoprotein in the oat gum extract. The gum was 98.4% glucose as determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The protein and ash contents were 1.3% (N x 6.25) and 0.30%, respectively. EDMW of the extracted gum was similar to 882 000. Viscosity of oat gum (0.5%) was stable over a wide range of pH (2-10), decreased with increased temperature and increased in the presence of sucrose (20-45%).

"This study evaluates the possible interaction between chronic oat bran intake and the postmeal metabolic response. Six normolipidemic men consumed three different diets for 14 d, at the end of which they consumed a test meal. The diets were C (control), basal low-fiber diet (15.6 g fiber/d) and a low-fiber (2.8 g fiber) test meal; OB (oat bran), basal low-fiber diet and a 40-g oat bran-enriched test meal (12.8 g fiber); and OB-A (oat bran-adaptation), 14-d oat bran (40 g/d) supplemented diet (23.8 g fiber/d) and an oat bran test meal (12.8 g fiber). The diets were fed in a random order. Fasting and postmeal blood samples were obtained for 7 h and lipoproteins were isolated. Adding oat bran to the test meals markedly reduced the postmeal insulin rise (P < 0.05). Compared with the low-fiber control diet, the effects elicited postprandially by adding oat bran to a single meal were enhanced after 14 d of oat bran feeding, ie, increased plasma triglycerides, phospholipids, and free cholesterol; decreased plasma esterified cholesterol; increased chylomicron and small-sized triglyceride-rich lipoprotein triglycerides; increased LDL and HDL free cholesterol; and decreased HDL esterified cholesterol.

"The relationship of oats and buckwheat intake to cardiovascular disease risk factors was studied in 850 Yi people, an ethnic minority in southwest China. Blood pressure was measured on 3 consecutive days. Serum total cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured after a 14-h fast. Oats and buckwheat intakes were assessed by questionnaire. In multiple-regression analysis, oats intake (100 g/d) was associated with lower body mass index (-0.25, in kg/m(2); P < 0.05), systolic (-3.1 mm Hg, P < 0.001) and diastolic (-1.3 mm Hg, P < 0.01) blood pressure, and HDL cholesterol (-0.13 mmol/L, P < 0.001).

"The high amount of soluble beta-glucans in oats may be responsible for beneficial effects on glucose tolerance and blood lipids. We studied 16 women and 7 men (aged 38-61 y) with moderately high cholesterol concentrations who consumed normal diets to which oat extracts with either 1% or 10% soluble beta-glucans were added. Oat extracts comprised 10% of energy and were consumed in a 5-wk crossover design after a 1-wk equilibration period. At the end of the equilibration period and each 5-wk period, a carbohydrate tolerance test was conducted and responses to glucose, glucose plus oat extract containing 1% glucan, or glucose plus oat extract containing 10% glucan were determined. Glucose responses were reduced by both extracts in both men and women; however, in women, responses to the 10% extract were lowest. Insulin responses did not differ between men and women, but were lower after oat extracts. Glucagon responses were higher initially in men and were lowered after oat extracts in men but not in women.

Compared with a cellulose control group the oat diets in both species gave a significantly higher cholesterol content in the HDL fraction and a significantly lower liver cholesterol content, No significant differences in total plasma cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and plasma triacylglycerols were found, however, between the groups fed on oats with different avenacoside content. The liver weight, total liver cholesterol and free liver cholesterol were also similar, whereas the liver lipid content was significantly lower in rats given the highest amount of avenacosides compared with zero or normal amounts.

"Three new high-yielding and rust-resistant naked oat cultivars (Avena sativa var. nuda), namely AC Hill, AC Lotta, and AC Percy, were assessed for their total protein content and amino acid composition using quantitative chromatographic methods. The total protein among these cultivars was very similar and ranged from 13.75% in AC Percy to 13.90 and 14.40% in AC Hill and AC Lotta, respectively. All cultivars were similar in amino acid composition. All cultivars contained a very good balance of the nine essential amino acids (EAA(9)) limited only in lysine, followed by threonine.

Both new oat cultivars contained a good balance of essential amino acids, i.e., EAA(9) = 44.2-45.4%, compared to the FAO/WHO reference protein pattern value of 33.9% for a 2-5-year-old child. The whole oat grains were limited only in lysine. They had an amino acid score, adjusted for digestibility, of 58% for Newman and 66.7% AC Stewart.

"To determine the stability of tocols (vitamin E) in oat products under various storage conditions, several oat products were stored in jars at -24 degrees C or in jars or envelopes at room temperature for up to seven months. At approximately monthly intervals, products were ground and tocols were extracted with methanol and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Tocols were stable for seven months in all products in jars at -24 degrees C. At room temperature, all tocols degraded in all processed products, but were stable in undried greats. Tocols degraded faster in envelopes than in jars at room temperature, indicating that air may be involved in the degradation process. alpha-Tocopherol and alpha-tocotrienol decreased faster than the other homologues during room temperature storage in envelopes, indicating differential stabilities. Analysis of hand-dissected fractions indicated that the germ was the location for most of the alpha- and gamma-tocopherol.

"The effects of storage and heat processing on the content and composition of free fatty acids (FFA) in oats (Avena saliva L.) have been studied. Samples of three cultivars (Kapp, Mustang, and Svea) were stored at 30, 55, and 80% rh for 3.5 and 15.5 months before heat processing of hulled and dehulled grains. Results from gas chromatographic analysis of individual FFA were closely correlated (r = 0.962) with measurements of acidity by titration of ethanol extracts. No significant differences in acidity were detected among the cultivars studied. After 3.5 months, the FFA content in the cultivar Kapp was 3.5 and 6.6 mg/g of dry matter when stored at 30 and 80% rh, respectively. After 15.5 months, FFA content increased to 5.4 and 11.3 mg/g of dry matter when stored at 30 and 80% rh, respectively. Measurement of acidity by titration was less specific and resulted in smaller relative differences. During processing, the FFA content and fat acidity was reduced by an average of 50%. This reduction in FFA is probably due to complexing of fatty acids, while the relative reduction in linolenic acid during storage and processing is related to an increasing content of volatile oxidation products, of which hexanal is an indicator. The total lipid content of oats did not change significantly during processing. After 15.5 months of storage, the lipid content was lower at 80% rh than at 30% rh; the content of ether-extractable lipids was 0.77 percentage points lower, while the content of total fatty acids was 0.43 percentage points lower.

"The lipase catalysed hydrolysis of triglycerides was studied in order to elucidate the factors that are responsible for the alkaline sensitivity of lipolysis in oat flour slurries above pH 8. An aqueous model system was used, in which oat flour extract or lipase of Candida cylindracea was incubated for 1 h with commercial 9 mM triolein (99%) or with 0.8% (w/v) of the triglyceride fraction of oat at pH range 7-9. At values higher than pH 8, hydrolysis was reduced to 0-20% of that observed at optimum pH of around 7, independent of the enzyme or substrate used. Therefore, the efficiency of inhibition markedly exceeded the values obtained in previous studies within the same pH range. At least four phenomena contribute to the inactivation: (1) instant reduction of catalytic activity upon elevation of pH; (2) time-dependent reduction of activity during approximately 30 min of incubation at alkaline pH; (3) increased sensitivity of the hydrolysis reaction to pH at low substrate concentrations; and (dr) increased pH sensitivity of hydrolysis in the presence of detergents or dispersing agents. Consequently, even slight pH adjustment into the alkaline range offers protection against lipolysis. Furthermore, the efficiency of this pH adjustment is dependent on how many of the above four contributing factors are included in an application.",1285,1,99,1,99,0,2,0,1,2,212
"Phytate reduction in oats during malting in a pilot-plant process and soaking under optimal conditions for oat phytase was studied to investigate whether the malting process developed in the laboratory was also applicable on a large scale. The effects of different drying and storage conditions were also investigated. In malted oats that had been dried at 30 degrees C and stored frozen and entire for 1.5 months, the phytate content was reduced to 0.2 mu mol/g (99% reduction) after soaking as a flour for 17 h at 37.8 degrees C. The same soaking, repeated with oats dried at 80 degrees C and stored as whole grains at +4 degrees C for 1.5 months, reduced the phytate content to 0.3 mu mol/g (98% reduction). Prolonged storage (12 months) resulted in slower phytate hydrolysis in oats dried at 80 degrees C (92% reduction) during soaking for 17 h at 37.8 degrees C. Pre-soaking of malted oat flour for 16 h at room temperature was used to achieve pH conditions that were closer to the optimum for phytase activity, thus resulting in more efficient phytate reduction. Of the conditions studied in this report, the optimum pH for oat phytase during soaking was found to be between pH 4 and 4.5. In whole malted grains, the phytate content was reduced at most by 79% after soaking as whole kernels.",1286,99,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,5,225
"Gelatinization and solubility characteristics of starch contribute to unique functionality in foods. Corn and oat starch viscoamylographs (35g db) showed peak viscosities of 400 and 390B.U., respectively. Oat starch had a more rapid (89.7 vs 85.6 degrees C) and higher set back (790 vs. 740B.U.) than corn. Data on soluble components of cooled (85 degrees C) starch pastes, as collected and analyzed by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), suggest that amylopectin plays a significant (P<0.05) role in oat paste set back; for corn starch, amylose is the dominant factor. Solubilities and apparent molecular weights (MW) of oat starch heated (65-120 degrees C) under shear and subsequent sonication (0-40s) in water or 90% methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were also determined by HPSEC. An intermediate MW fraction was eluted on the HPSEC chromatograms only when oat starch was heated in water (100-120 degrees C/30min) or DMSO and sonicated, suggesting that this fraction may not be inherent in the native granule, in water, polymer solubility and peak MW increased with temperature (65-120 degrees C), whereas in DMSO, solubility decreased with heating (65-100 degrees C), while peak MW remained basically constant. Aqueous tag) leaching at 75 degrees C solubilized more corn amylose than amylopectin, but amylopectin and amylose co-leached from oat starch granules. Aq leaching, at 20 degrees C above their DSC peak ends (85 and 95 degrees C for oat and corn, resepctively), showed more amylopectin leached from oat starch granules whereas more amylose was leached from corn starch granules.",1287,99,99,-1,99,99,0,1,0,4,246
"Oats were used as a base for a fermented nutrient solution for enteral feeding. The fermented soup, made from 18.5% oatmeal (w /w) was fluid enough to pass through a thin tube and contained a high amount of viable lactic acid bacteria. The oat-based soup contained about 76% of the energy and 70% of the protein compared to the average nutrient content in nutritive solutions marketed in Sweden. It was also rich in beta-glucans, thiamin, phosphorus, iron, copper and manganese. Two different starter cultures were studied, Lactobacillus reuteri strain 108 isolated from human intestine and Lactobacillus plantarum strain 299V isolated from a sour dough. Influences of some additives on the fermentation properties of the Lactobacillus strains were investigated. The amount of glucose was shown to be sufficient in the oat solution for fermentation by lactobacilli. An addition of malted barley flour (MBF), proteases and amino acids, respectively, influenced the properties of the oatmeal soup by increasing the rate of pH-decrease and the total amount of lactobacilli in the final product. The requirements of amino acids of the starter cultures were shown to be higher for L. reuteri strain 108 than for L. plantarum strain 299V.",1288,0,1,-1,99,1,2,1,1,1,195
"Objective: The role of fiber in tube feeding products has not clearly been defined. While some studies suggest that fiber can increase stool weight and bowel transit time in acutely ill patients, there is less information in stable patients receiving chronic enteral nutritional support. Design: Using a crossover study design, we investigated the effect of 28.8 g/day of a 50% soy and 50% oat fiber combination in 10 medically stable residents of a chronic care facility. Subjects were randomized to initially receive 10 days of either Isocal HN or Ultracal, which are identical in composition except Ultracal contains 14.4 g/L of fiber. After the first 10-day study, subjects underwent a washout followed by a second 10-day study using the other product. Fecal dye markers were used to identify appropriate collection times. Results: Fiber significantly increased the number of bowel movements per day (0.9 +/- 0.4 vs 0.5 a 0.2, p < 0.05) and fecal weights (57 +/- 31 vs 32 +/- 25 g/day, p < 0.05). Fiber also caused a significant increase in fecal nitrogen output (110 +/- 65 vs 75 +/- 74 mg/day, p < 0.05) and fecal energy (141 +/- 73 vs 76 +/- 62 kcal/day, p < 0.05). Fiber did not affect fecal moisture, gastric emptying, or intestinal transit time. Conclusion: We conclude that the addition of a combination of soy and oat fiber to tube feeding material is well tolerated, and promotes regular bowel movements without altering the rate of gastric emptying or intestinal transit time.",1289,1,0,0,1,-1,2,1,2,0,250
"Four pigs fitted with two sets of re-entrant cannulas in the upper jejunum were used to study the effect of two oat-flour (F)- and oat-bran (B)-based diets without or with (FC and BC respectively) addition of 148 g wood cellulose/kg on jejunal flow and absorption of glucose over an isolated loop of jejunum. Mean transit time (MTT) of flow from the proximal re-entrant cannula increased from approximately 1.5 h with diet F to 2h when feeding diet BC. Both the replacement of oat flour by oat bran and the supplementation of the diets with cellulose led to a significantly longer MTT for dry matter and the carbohydrates, except that cellulose did not have a significant effect on the MTT for the total non-starch polysaccharides. Only the addition of cellulose significantly delayed gastric emptying of the added liquid-phase (Polyethylene glycol 4000) and solid-phase (Cr2O3) markers, whereas no effect of the oat source used was seen. Feeding diets with a higher level of dietary fibre (DP) and lower content of starch, obtained by substitution with cellulose or by feeding oat bran instead of oat flour, reduced the recovery of starch from an isolated loop of jejunum. Consequently, the quantitative absorption of starch was not significantly different between diets when starch was related to the recovery of external markers. However, when related to the recovery of arabinoxylan (AX) there was a significantly lower absorption of starch from the bran-based diets in comparison with the flour-based diets. The capacity to digest and absorb the large quantities of starch entering the duodenum after a carbohydrate-rich meal appears to be the limiting factor for absorption in the upper jejunum. Therefore, any effect of DF on the rate of absorption of glucose is presumably an effect on gastric emptying rather than displacement of the site of starch absorption in the small intestine.

"An extract from oats known as oat gum (OG) is composed mainly of the polysaccharide (1-->3) (1-->4)-beta-D-glucan, which is highly viscous in aqueous solution. Viscous polysaccharides are known to attenuate postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses. The purposes of this study were to determine the dose-response to OG and establish quantitatively the effect of viscosity on plasma glucose and insulin levels of healthy humans consuming 50 g glucose. Increasing the dose of OG successively reduced the plasma glucose and insulin responses relative to a control without gum. Reduction of the viscosity of OG by acid hydrolysis reduced or eliminated the capacity to decrease postprandial glucose and insulin levels. The ability of OG to modify glycaemic response was unchanged following agglomeration in the presence of maltodextrin. Agglomerated gum dispersed smoothly in a drink without formation of lumps, and development of maximum viscosity was delayed. These properties improve palatability. There was a highly significant linear relationship between log[viscosity] of the mixtures consumed and the glucose and insulin responses. The relationship shows that 79-96% of the changes in plasma glucose and insulin are attributable to viscosity, and that changes occur at relatively low doses and viscosities.",1291,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,3,0,193
"Nine early and 11 midseason oat cultivars grown at 18 locations in the central and eastern United States were used to evaluate the ability of whole moist caryopses immersed in soybean oil to hydrolyze the oil. Significant differences in cultivars for mean of percentage hydrolysis were observed in both early and midseason groups. Percentage hydrolysis was correlated negatively with great percentage for both early and midseason oat cultivars. Percentage hydrolysis was negatively correlated with the caryopsis weight for early cultivars. Oat caryopses harvested 15 days postanthesis had greater hydrolytic activity per unit weight than those harvested 30 days postanthesis. The hydrolytic activity of oat line B605-1085 varied significantly from year to year and was markedly higher in 1988, a very dry year.",1292,99,-1,1,99,99,1,1,0,3,122
"The effects of hard white and hard red winter wheats (whole flour, bran, straight-grade flour) and oatmeal on rat weight gains, serum and liver cholesterol levels, fecal fat, neutral sterols, and bile acids were compared. No differences in weight gains or feed efficiencies were noted for animals fed red versus white whole flours, brans or straight-grade flours. Only animals fed the white wheat bran diet gained less weight than the control animals. The bran diets were the least efficient feeds. By the end of week 8, animals fed red wheat diets tended to have lower serum cholesterol levels than those fed respective white wheat diets, but the difference was significant only in animals fed whole wheat flour. The wheat brans, whole red flour, red straight-grade flour, and oatmeal diets were hypocholestrolemic compared to the control diet. No significant differences occurred in liver cholesterol levels between groups fed respective hard white versus hard red wheat diets. Animals fed bran diets had significantly lower liver cholesterol concentrations than did those fed whole flour or straight-grade flour, but concentrations were similar to those of animals fed the oatmeal diet. Correlation analysis showed significant inverse relationships between total serum cholesterol and dietary fiber (especially soluble fiber), amount of fecal fat and neutral sterols excreted daily, dietary phenolics and phytic acid, and diet viscosity. The relationships were stronger for liver cholesterol. All of these factors may contribute to the hypocholestrolemic properties of grain diets.",1293,0,0,1,1,1,3,0,2,0,239
"The effects of oatmeal and various fractions from a hard white and hard red winter wheat on rat weight gains and fecal loss of protein, ash, calcium, and zinc were compared. Oatmeal diets produced weight gains similar to those of the whole wheat flour diets. No significant differences occurred in weight gains between animals fed diets containing whole flour, straight-grade flour, or bran of the hard white wheat and those fed respective hard red winter wheat diets. Although caloric contents of the wheat bran diets were lower than those of the other diets and bran-fed rats lost more protein and ash in feces, animals fed the bran diets gained as much weight as those fed straight-grade flour diets. Feed intake was highest in bran-fed animals, and the bran diets were the least efficient feeds. Animals fed bran diets had the highest wet and dry fecal weight and highest fecal water-holding capacity; no differences occurred between the hard white and hard red winter bran diets. Fecal water-holding capacity was strongly correlated with total dietary fiber (r = 0.9738, P = 0.0001). Animals fed oatmeal lost the least amount of calcium per day, had the lowest percent loss of calcium, and absorbed more calcium than those fed red or white wheat diets or the control diet, which contained cellulose. Greatest daily loss of zinc occurred with the wheat bran diets, but zinc concentration and daily amounts of zinc absorbed also were highest with those diets. More zinc was absorbed per day from the oatmeal diet than from all other diets, except those containing wheat brans. An inverse relationship was observed between percent calcium loss and soluble dietary fiber (r = -0.4996, P = 0.003), whereas no significant correlation occurred between insoluble and total dietary fiber or phytic acid and percent calcium loss. However, significant correlations were observed between the daily amount of zinc in feces and insoluble dietary fiber (r 0.8709, P = 0.0001), total dietary fiber (r = 0.9137, P = 0.0001), and phytic acid (r = 0.9552, P =",1294,0,99,1,0,0,1,0,3,1,339
"To understand the fate of oat saponins during processing, isolated avenacosides A and B were heated at 100 and 140 degrees C at different pH. The catalytic effect of soluble iron complexes and stainless steel was also examined. The avenacosides were stable when heated up to 100 degrees C for 3 h at pH 4-7. Heating at 140 degrees C, especially at pH 4, led to partial destruction of the oat saponins. A degradation product was detected and identified by mass spectrometry as desrhamnoavenacosides A and B. Addition of catalytic amounts of iron and stainless steel dramatically increased the rate of saponin breakdown at pH 4-6. This could in part explain the reduction of the saponin content in canned and roller-dried products.",1295,1,99,1,99,99,2,0,0,3,122
"The application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer at both seeding and the boot stage of plant development (Zadoks 40-43) and/or delayed seeding caused changes in the protein, oil and beta-glucan contents of four oat cultivars in field studies conducted in Quebec Canada, between 1990 and 1992. N fertilizer applied at the boot stage (Zadoks 40-49) tended to increase protein content and to decrease oil content, however, beta-glucan content did not respond significantly to additional N. Generally, delayed seeding increased protein and beta-glucan contents and decreased oil content. In 1992, however, protein and oil contents tended to increase with delayed seeding, while beta-glucan was not affected significantly, although not all cultivars responded in a similar fashion. Environmental conditions during the growing season seemed to influence the effects of delayed seeding on protein, oil and beta-glucan contents because results varied among years. While some cultivar x management treatment interactions were significant, the ranking of the four cultivars was generally consistent across experiments. Thus, if improvement in these characteristics is required, genotype x management interactions should not interfere unduly with the evaluation of late-generation breeding materials for protein, oil and beta-glucan contents.",1296,1,99,99,99,-1,1,1,0,3,188

"Oat (Avena sativa L.) starches isolated from three lines of groats containing a range of lipid contents (6.2, 8.0, and 11.2%) were evaluated. The lipid content of the starches varied from 1.08 to 1.18%, which was higher than that of corn (Zea mays L.) starches (0.56-0.66%). The amylose content of oat starches (measured by blue value) ranged from 22.1 to 26.6%. In corn starches, it ranged from 24.0 to 24.6 and was positively correlated with the starch-lipid content. The oat starches had a smaller average granule size, lower molecular weight, and lower clarity of starch paste than did corn starches also evaluated in this study, as measured by scanning electron microscopy, limiting viscosity number, and percentage transmittance, respectively. The granule size and clarity of oat starches were negatively correlated to amylose and starch-lipid content. The swelling power and solubility of starches increased with a rise in temperature from 85 to 95-degrees-C. The increased values were higher in oat starches than they were in corn starches. Furthermore, as measured by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography, oat starch amyloses had a shorter chain length than did corn starches, and the chain length tended to decrease with increased amylose and starch-lipid content. Differences in chain length and chain-length distribution of amylopectin also were noted among oat starch types, with the short chain length (A and short B chains) of amylopectin increasing with increased amylose and starch-lipid content.",1299,1,99,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,232
"The pasting, gel strength, and thermal properties of oat (Avena sativa L.) starches, isolated from three types of groats containing a range of lipid contents (6.2, 8.0, and 11.2%), were investigated. The relationships between these functional properties and structural characteristics were determined. Two corn (Zea mays L.) starches also were evaluated for comparison. The oat starches tended to have a higher pasting temperature and a lower peak viscosity (89.5-93-degrees-C and 155-210 BU, respectively) than did corn starches (83.6-86.8-degrees-C and 270-310 BU, respectively), as measured by the Brabender Viscoamylograph. The firmness, as measured by the Voland-Stevens texture analyzer, was less for oat than it was for corn starch gels, and firmness was negatively correlated with starch-lipid content during all storage periods. The stickiness was greater for oat than it was for corn starch gels at 5 hr of storage; it was the same for both starches during remaining storage. The stickiness was positively correlated with the starch-lipid content during all storage periods. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the oat starches had a lower gelatinization temperature (T(o)) and a lower enthalpy (DELTAH) value for transition of the starch crystallites than did the corn starches. This suggests less order in the crystalline structure of the former starches. The oat starches also had a higher DELTAH value for the transition of the amylose-lipid complex and a lower percentage of retrogradation (%r) than did the corn starches, maybe because of a greater starch-lipid content in the former starches. Furthermore, the T(o) of oat starches was positively correlated with amylose (r = 0.97) and starch-lipid (r = 0.92) contents (P < 0.01), whereas %r was negatively correlated with amylopectin content (r = -0.84, P < 0.01).",1300,99,0,1,1,99,2,0,1,2,280
"Objective: To study the effect of the presence and quality of dietary fibre in ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast cereals on completeness of carbohydrate digestion in children and on starch susceptibility to alpha-amylase in vitro. Design: A controlled intervention study. Subjects: Eight 3-8-year-old healthy children. Interventions: Completeness of digestion was evaluated by assessing the amount of carbohydrates apparently fermented into the colon using the breath-H-2 technique after consumption in random order, of five breakfast tests containing boiled rice (either alone or supplemented with 3 g of lactulose) as reference food, or RTE cereals based on rice (low-fibre), wheat (high insoluble fibre) and oats (high-soluble fibre). The potential glycaemic impact of the products was estimated in vitro by assessing starch susceptibility to alpha-amylolysis using an enzymatic-dialysis method. Results: Compared to boiled rice and to rice-based RTE cereal, wheat- and oat-based RTE cereals both significantly (P < 0.05) increased the amount of apparently fermented carbohydrates (+1.1 +/- 1.7% of total breakfast carbohydrate fermented for rice, +5.6 +/- 0.9% for wheat and +9.4 +/- 3.7% for oats; mean +/- SEM), calculated using the excess H-2 in breath after lactulose as standard. All products showed similar in vitro digestibility, resulting in estimated glycaemic indexes of 117.5 (24.0) for rice, and 105.7 (14.1) for oats-based, 128.4 (17.6) for wheat-based, and 129.8 (16.6) [mean 95% CI)] for rice-based RTE cereals. Conclusions: Results suggest that the presence of fibre in RTE breakfast cereals, in particular soluble fibre, increases colonic fermentation in children whereas it seems not to affect glucose availability.

"We studied the theological properties of water-soluble, mixed-linkage beta-glucans of high purity (88-99.5%) isolated from oats. Comparing the beta-glucan fractions at the same concentration (1.3 mg/g) the mean value of the bran fraction viscosities was larger (by 5X) than the mean viscosity of endosperm fractions. Both mean values had a relative standard deviation of approximate to 20%. Heat treatment of oats did not alter the viscous properties of the extracted beta-glucans. Activation energies for the bran fraction at two shear rates were E(gamma=5.81) = 42 kJ/mole and E(gamma=5.81) = 17 kJ/mole. The variation in G' and G'' with frequency for the beta-glucan from bran fractions could be qualitatively described by a superposition of two single Maxwell models with widely different relaxation time. These data can help predict potential processing effects on such fractions incorporated as food components.",1302,1,1,0,1,99,3,0,1,1,137
"The effectiveness of high-protein oat flour, a by-product of an oat starch process, was studied in bread baking and sausage processing. Its impact on sensory properties of products was assessed. High-protein oat flour enhanced water absorption and mixing stability of the dough. Some weakening of dough was found as indicated by a decrease in extensibility and resistance. Addition of oat flour increased loaf volume, enlarged grain size and darkened crumb color. It also caused some off-odors assessed as a decrease in ''cleanness'' of aroma. Sausages containing high-protein oat flour formed an external gel-like layer under the casing during processing, probably caused by the low pH of the flour. In sensory analyses the sausages were judged less firm and juicy than the control. The ''cleanness'' of odor and flavor of the sausages was distinctively diminished. Cereal products should be considered the primary products for utilization of high-protein oat flour.",1303,1,99,99,-1,0,1,1,1,2,148

"The effect of cereal-based diets varying in dietary fibre (DF) on gastric emptying and glucose absorption over an isolated loop of jejunum was studied in four pigs fitted with two sets of re-entrant cannulas. The pigs were fed on either a wheat-hour diet or three diets based on oat flour (endosperm), rolled oats or oat bran containing different amounts of soluble DF. Mean transit time (MTT) of liquid estimated from the output from the first jejunal cannula was significantly higher with the two diets having the highest DP content, but MTT of dry matter (DM), starch, xylose and neutral non-starch polysaccharides (nNSP) was not correlated directly to the DF content of the diet. DP had a stimulatory effect on secretion of gastrointestinal juices, but the effect was not linearly correlated with the DP content of the diet. Starch was significantly degraded in digesta collected within 30 min after feeding with maltooligosaccharides accounting for 140-147 g/kg total starch. The degradation was more extensive with higher DF and lower starch content of the diet. However, taking into account the differences in jejunal how, the amount of malto-oligosaccharides available for absorption in the first 0.5 h decreased with higher levels of DF in the oat-based diets. The absorption of glucose from the isolated loop was 18-34 g/m intestine over an 8 h period with no significant differences between diets. This corresponded to a non-significant decrease in recovery of starch from 0.91 to 0.82 with increasing levels of DF and decreasing levels of starch in the diet. This suggests that the capacity for absorption of large doses of starch entering the proximal small intestine after ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich cereal-based diet has a major influence on the absorption at this site. Consequently any effect of DP on glucose absorption may be exerted either through the rate of gastric emptying or by impaired rate of absorption more distal in the small intestine and not by displacement of the site for starch absorption.",1306,0,0,99,1,1,2,0,2,1,327
"To improve the economic feasibility of hydrolyzing fats and oils with moist oat caryopses, various factors affecting the efficiency of the process were studied. Caryopses produced with an impact-type dehuller exhibited greater lipase activity than those produced by a wringer-type dehuller. Abrasion of oat caryopses against each other in a fluidized bed released particles rich in lipase. Such Lipase concentrates could be added to moist caryopsis reactors to speed fat hydrolysis. Beef tallow, lard, soybean oil and crambe oil were hydrolyzed more efficiently than corn oil, castor oil and milk fat. The poor hydrolysis of castor oil was attributed to the formation of esters with the hydroxy group of ricinoleic acid, and the hydrolysis of castor oil was increased by dilution of the substrate with hexane. Diglycerides inhibited the hydrolysis and accounted for the slower hydrolysis of corn oil. Hydrolysis of milk fat by moist oat caryopses resulted in preferential hydrolysis of C-6 to C-10 acids. Erucic acid was released from crambe oil at significantly slower rates than the other acyl groups. High conversions of fats and oils to free fatty acids could be attained by (i) exposing the fats and oils to two to three lots of moist caryopses, (ii) the use of special oat varieties with elevated lipase content, (iii) the addition of oat lipase concentrates to moist caryopsis reactors, and (iv) dilution of the substrate with hexane. Estimates of the cost of producing free fatty acids with these processes indicated that the first three should be profitable. Growth of Clostridium sporogenes spores could not be demonstrated in caryopsis reactors. During the incubation of moist oat caryopses immersed in oil, the free fatty acid content of the internal caryopsis lipid increased only slightly, but there were changes in its fatty acid composition.",1307,0,-1,1,99,0,1,1,2,1,294
"Enzymatic hydrolysis of oat and soy lecithins and its effects on the functional properties of lecithins were investigated. The phospholipase used was most efficient at low enzyme and substrate concentrations, More fatty acids were released from soy lecithin than from oat lecithin. The maximum degree of hydrolysis was 760 mu mol free fatty acids per gram soy lecithin and 170 mu mol free fatty acids per gram oat lecithin. On the basis of the total carbohydrate and phosphorus contents in the polar fractions of the lecithins, oat lecithin contained more glycolipids and less phospholipids than soy lecithin. With regard to functional properties, the stability of oil in water emulsions was enhanced by hydrolyzed soy lecithin and by crude and hydrolyzed oat lecithins, but only hydrolyzed soy lecithin prevented the recrystallization of barley starch. The dissociation enthalpy of amylose-lipid complex (AML-complex) was significantly higher when hydrolyzed soy lecithin was present. Hydrolyzed oat lecithin slightly affected the dissociation enthalpy of AML complex. The other lecithins had no effect on recrystallization or dissociation enthalpies in the barley-starch matrix.",1308,-1,1,0,0,1,2,1,2,0,175

Consumption was equivalent to a daily dose of about 70 g of oat bran. Setting: The study was with free-living individuals. Subjects: Twenty hypercholesterolemic male and female adults entered, and 19 completed, the study. Interventions: Blood lipids from fasting individuals were measured weekly throughout the study. Diet was monitored using 3 day food diaries. Results: There were no significant changes (P > 0.05) in blood lipids during the placebo phase. Mean initial total cholesterol (6.76 +/- 0.13 mmol/l) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (4.59 +/- 0.14 mmol/l) levels fell throughout the oat gum phase, and at week 4 each was reduced 9% relative to initial values (P = 0.0004 and 0.005 respectively). When oat gum was discontinued, total and LDL cholesterol returned to initial levels. There were no significant changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Triglyceride levels also remained unchanged except for a singular decrease at week 4 of the oat gum phase relative to the initial value, but not compared to the placebo value. The lowered mean total and LDL cholesterol levels occurred in the absence of any dietary changes. Conclusions: The main component of the soluble fibre of oats, Beta-glucan, significantly reduced the total and LDL cholesterol levels of hypercholesterolemic adults without changing HDL cholesterol.",1309,1,-1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,294
"The effects of rye bran, oat bran and soya-bean fibre on serum lipids, bile composition and gallstone formation were studied in male Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). The control groups received fibre-free stone-provoking (01 diet) or non-stone-provoking (02 diet) diets. The serum cholesterol levels were lower for all groups fed an the diets supplemented with the dietary fibre sources compared with the control groups. The total content of bile acids in bile was higher in groups given rye-bran diets compared with the corresponding controls. The proportion of cholic acid was higher and that of chenodeoxycholic and lithocholic acid lower in the groups given rye-bran-, oat-bran- or soya-bean-fibre-supplemented diets, compared,vith the corresponding controls. The secondary:primary bile acid ratio was lower in the group given the rye-bran-supplemented 01 diet. The lithocholic: deoxycholic acid ratio was lower in the groups given rye-bran-, oat-bran- or soya-bean-fibre-supplemented diets than in the corresponding controls. A lower frequency of gallstones was observed only for the group receiving the rye-bran-supplemented 01 diet while the lithogenic index was lower in the groups given the rye-bran-supplemented 02 diet. A decreased epithelial volume density of the gall-bladder and an increased smooth muscular volume density were observed in animals given oat-bran- and rye-bran-supplemented 01 diets, whereas for the soya-bean-fibre-supplemented 01 diet, only the smooth muscular volume density was increased.",1310,-1,1,1,0,1,3,1,1,0,217
"Starches isolated from three types of oats (Avena sativa L.) with a range of lipid contents (6.2, 8.0, and 11.2%) were fractionated into amylose (AM), amylopectin (AP), and intermediate materials (IM) by using 1-butanol precipitation. The structures and physicochemical properties of AM, AP, and IM were characterized by using iodine affinity (IA), blue value, maximum absorbance wavelength, limiting viscosity number, and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography before and after debranching with isoamylase for AM and after debranching for AP and IM. The IA values of AM were 18.4-18.9 g/100 g of starch. The weight-average degree of polymerization (DP(w)) and apparent DP(w) distribution of AM ranged from 939 to 1,208 and from 392 to 2,920 glucose units, respectively. These values tended to be smaller than those of corn (Zea mays L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) starches reported in literature. The AP had IA values ranging from 0.30 to 0.58 g/100 g of starch. The chain lengths of AP ranged from 204 to 181, 32 to 31, and 20 to 17, by weight of glucose units, for high, intermediate, and low molecular weight fractions, respectively. The chain lengths and chain-length distribution of AP showed differences among oat starch types, with a decreased degree of multiple branching of AP accompanying increased starch-lipid and amylose contents. All structures and properties of IM suggested that the IM contained less highly branched molecules than did AP.",1311,99,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,5,229
"Freeze-dried wheat water solubles (WWS) recovered from a by-product stream of a gluten-starch washing plant could be substituted for 10% of the egg whites in an angel food cake formula. Higher substitution resulted in cakes with reduced volume and poor texture. Whipping time increased as percent of substitution of WWS for egg whites increased. Substitution of WWS for egg whites at all levels decreased batter viscosity. An eight-week rat-feeding study showed no significant differences in overall weight gains, feed efficiencies, and feed intakes in animals fed diets containing WWS, oat bran, or cellulose (control). However, serum cholesterol levels were significantly higher in animals fed the diet containing WWS, in comparison to those fed oat bran or control diets. Animals fed oat bran had a significantly higher percent of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower liver cholesterol than did animals fed any other diet. Diet slurry viscosity was inversely related to total serum and liver cholesterol concentrations and directly correlated with percentage of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. WWS appear to have no potential as a dietary hypocholesterolemic agent.",1312,99,1,0,1,0,2,0,2,1,176
"The oat starch studied had a lipid content of 1,3% and amylose content of 29%. Based on the colorimetric assay, only 15% of the starch leached out from the native granules at 95-degrees-C was amylose, whereas 85% of the starch leached from the defatted granules was amylose. The solubilized amylopectin-type material of native oat starch was of clearly lower molecular weight than most of the amylopectin in the original starch. The amylopectin recrystallization enthalpy of 50% native oat starch dispersion Id after gelatinization was 2J/g and that of defatted oat starch was 4J/g.",1314,0,0,99,99,0,0,0,3,2,93
"High-protein oat flour containing approximately 50% protein was derived as a by-product from an oat starch process integrated with ethanol production. The protein composition of the by-product was characterized in comparison to that of oat groats, the raw material of the process, to evaluate alterations occurring during processing. The proteins were fractionated according to their solubility. Amino acids of the fractions were analyzed as 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate derivatives by high-performance liquid chromatography, and molecular weight distribution was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, functionality (in terms of protein solubility, water absorption, and emulsifying capacity) of the high-protein oat flour was compared with that of a commercial soy concentrate at a pH range of 3.0-7.0. Processing caused changes in the proportion of salt-soluble and alkali-soluble but not in the proportion of water-soluble or alcohol-soluble fractions. In oat groats, the alkali-soluble fraction accounted for 52% of the total nitrogen, and the salt-soluble fraction accounted for 28%. In high-protein oat flour, almost 80% of nitrogen was collected in the alkali-soluble fraction; the salt-soluble fraction accounted for <3% of the total nitrogen. The amino acid composition and molecular weight distribution of the protein fractions were not severly altered during processing. Solubility and emulsifying properties of the high-protein oat flour were competitive with those of the soy concentrate. Commericial soy concentrate, however, absorbed three to four times more water than did the oat flour over the pH range studied.",1315,1,99,99,0,99,1,0,1,3,237
"Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) calibrations were developed for analysis of protein and oil content in ground oat groats. Calibrations based on accepted reference procedures yielded coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.95 for protein and 0.99 for oil content. Standard errors of calibration (SEC) of 0.40 and 0.10% were determined for the protein and oil calibrations, respectively. Linear relationships were determined between protein reference measurements (AACC Method 46-10) and NIRS protein estimates in the calibration sample set (r = 0.98). A similar strong correlation coefficient of 0.99 was found in the comparison of oil content determined by NIRS and AACC Method 30-20. The NIRS methods were validated using samples independent of those used in calibration development. Analysis of 17 oat cultivars grown in 1989 and 1990 at seven locations in South Dakota (n = 238) revealed cultivar to be an important factor in influencing groat protein and oil content. Growing location was not a significant factor in protein and oil content variability.",1316,99,99,1,99,99,1,0,0,4,161
"The present work shows the results of total fiber (T.F.) analyses carried out on oat cultivars and new commercial products (pasta and extruded-products) integrated with oat flour. oat addition determines good contents of T.F. both in extruded and pasta products, suggesting that its utilization, or of the similar products, could allow an easier increase in total dietary fiber intake. Significant differences were found between oat varieties in T.F. content.",1317,1,99,1,1,99,3,0,0,2,69
"This experiment was conducted during three consecutive years with 144 Ayrshire bulls of an initial age of 185 days and live weight of 186 kg. The experimental period lasted for 224 days. The ad libitum fed roughages were grass silage, hay and oat straw, each supplemented with four levels of concentrates, the number of treatments thus being 12. Daily supplements of concentrates were 0, 1, 2 or 3 kg on grass silage feeding, 1, 2, 3 or 4 kg on hay feeding and 2, 3, 4 or 5 kg on straw feeding. Barley was used as a concentrate on grass silage feeding, but part of it was replaced by rapeseed meal and urea in the hay and straw feeding groups to balance the nitrogen intake. An increase in concentrate intake was found to decrease the roughage intake with each type of roughage, but the total intake of dry matter (DM) was increased. Increasing the level of concentrates enhanced both the rate of daily live weight gain (LWG) and carcass gain. However, 2 kg more concentrates was needed on hay feeding than on grass silage feeding to obtain similar carcass gain. On straw feeding, 4 kg of concentrates was not sufficient to obtain a comparable carcass gain as with grass silage alone. The response to concentrate supplementation on grass silage feeding indicated, however, that the growth potential of the bulls receiving silage alone or silage with small amounts (1 or 2 kg/day) of concentrates was not completely utilized. The study showed that LWG is an inadequate measure of animal performance when diets with different fill characteristics are compared. With coarse diets, a relatively large proportion of LWG is rumen contents. Comparisons of animal performance and feed conversion should, instead, be done in terms of carcass gain.",1318,1,0,1,99,1,3,0,1,1,295
"Use of oats treated with propionic acid in horse feeding was investigated in a 48-day feeding trial. Twenty horses were divided into a control and an experimental group. Horses in the control and experimental groups were fed with hay and dry or propionic acid treated oats, respectively, according to their energy requirements. The influence of the diet on health, faecal microflora, haemoglobin and haematocrit values, blood serum glucose concentrations, and weight change was investigated. The state of the health of all the horses was good throughout the trial. The functioning of the digestive tract of the horses was normal, since no symptoms of a declined health status of the digestive tract or harmfull effects on microflora due to propionic acid treated oats were observed. Also the haematology of the horses was unaffected by die diet. These data indicated that propionic acid treated grain can succesfully be included in rations for horses.",1319,1,1,0,1,0,3,0,2,0,151
"Water-soluble fiber has been reported to reduce serum cholesterol and consequently, oat bran, which has a high soluble-fiber content, has been recommended as part of a lipid-lowering diet. However, a recent small study of 20 volunteers with low mean serum cholesterol concentrations (4.8 mmol/L) demonstrated no lipid-lowering effect of oat bran. The present study investigated 64 volunteers with cholesterol concentrations much more typical of the UK population (6 mmol/L). Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either a normal-sized helping of an oat-based cereal or a cereal containing no oats for 4 wk and then crossed over to the alternative regimen for a further 4 wk. Small (2.23% and 4.55%) but significant (P<0.04 and P<0.05) reductions in total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, respectively, were observed in association with the consumption of oat-based cereal. These data support the view that consumption of oat-based cereals may well contribute usefully to a lipid-lowering diet.",1320,1,-1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,149
"The distribution of (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan) in grains was studied using scanning microspectrofluorometry of cell-wall-bound Calcofluor in selected cultivars of oats and barley. Microspectrofluorometric imaging showed a high concentration of beta-glucan in the depleted layer adjacent to the embryo in all oat cultivars examined. In the low beta-glucan oat OA516-2, a high concentration of beta-glucan was also seen in the subaleurone region in cross sections of the proximal, central, and distal areas of the kernel. In the high beta-glucan cultivar Marion, the relative fluorescence intensity of the bound Calcofluor was high throughout the central endosperm. Morphological differences were observed in the central endosperm of the two cultivars, with Marion having somewhat smaller cells and slightly thicker walls, which would result in a greater concentration of beta-glucan per unit volume than that in OA516-2. Very little beta-glucan was observed in the embryo in either oat cultivar. In a comparison of maps of central cross sections of five cultivars of differing beta-glucan content (range 3.7-6.4%), there was a trend for the high subaleurone concentration of beta-glucan to become less distinct as the total beta-glucan content of the cultivars increased. The distribution of beta-glucan in barley was more uniform, with no high subaleurone concentration of beta-glucan in any of the five cultivars examined (beta-glucan range: 2.8-11%). The highest concentration of beta-glucan was in the central endosperm.",1321,0,0,0,99,1,1,0,3,1,222
"The effect of heat-moisture treatment (30% moisture, 100C, 16 h) and annealing (75% moisture, 50C, 72 h) on the flow behavior of gelatinized starch pastes from wheat, oat, lentil and potato starches were studied at a concentration of 6% starch with a cone and plate viscometer (Wells Brookfield RVTDV II CP 200). The power law rheological model (sigma = K(gamma)n) was used to describe the flow behavior of the above starch pastes. All native starches exhibited a non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior. A thixotropic loop was evident only in oat starches and native potato starch. Among native starches, the magnitude of the shear thinning index (n) followed the order: oat > wheat > lentil > potato, while the corresponding order for the consistency index (K) was: potato > lentil > wheat > oat. Heat-moisture treatment decreased the K value of all starches. On annealing, K decreased in wheat and lentil starches, but increased in potato and oat starches. Heat-moisture treatment and annealing increased the n value of wheat, lentil and potato starches, but decreased that of oat starch. In all starches, the modification to the flow behavior was more marked on heat-moisture treatment than on annealing.",1322,99,99,99,99,1,1,0,0,4,195
"Native wheat, oat, potato and lentil starches were annealed at various starch/water ratios at 50C for time intervals ranging from 0.5 to 72 h. Annealing did not change granule size and shape. Oat starch granules were less compactly packed after annealing. X-ray diffraction patterns remained unchanged and X-ray intensities changed only marginally in all starches. The swelling factor (SF), amylose leaching (AML) and the gelatinization temperature range (GTR) decreased on annealing. The extent of decrease in SF and AML followed the order: lentil > wheat > potato > oat, while the corresponding order for GTR was: wheat > lentil > oat > potato. The gelatinization transition temperatures (GTT) and enthalpy (DELTAH) increased on annealing. However, the increases in GTT and DELTAH did not begin concurrently during the time course of annealing. Increases in DELTAH were slower and were evident only after 1, 2, 6 and 48 h, respectively, in lentil, potato, oat and wheat starches. The extent and rate of increase in GTT and DELTAH followed the order: potato > lentil > wheat > oat. The magnitude of changes in GTT and DELTAH increased with increase in annealing moisture content. The susceptibility of oat starch to enzyme and acid hydrolysis increased on annealing. However, decreases occurred in the other starches (lentil > wheat > potato). Thermal and shear stability of starch granules increased on annealing (potato > lentil > wheat > oat). The results showed that the above changes in physicochemical properties were due to increased interaction between starch components during annealing.",1323,99,99,1,-1,99,1,1,0,3,252
"Amylodextrins with soluble beta-glucan contents from 1 to 10% were prepared from oats and the hypocholesterolemic properties of the latter were evaluated. The products are called OATRIM and can lower blood cholesterol by replacing animal fats rich in cholesterol in food products and, possibly, by the action of beta-glucan in the body after consumption. In the chick model, decreased total blood cholesterol also resulted in increases of HDL cholesterol and decreases of LDL cholesterol. Processing conditions were found that gave the maximum amount of beta-glucan and desirable fat-replacement qualities with the least amount of color and flavor.",1324,1,1,99,99,1,3,0,0,2,97
"The effect of inclusion of oat fractions on bread quality was evaluated. An oat flour inclusion of about 10% (as a partial replacement for the soft white flour) proved optimum for brown soda breads and enhanced crust colour and crumb softness. In yeasted white breads, an oat flake inclusion rate of 5% (in addition to the wheaten flour) was optimum and gave bread with an enhanced loaf volume and a softer, creamier crumb in the presence of added gluten. In the absence of added gluten, the addition of oat flakes caused crumb hardening and a reduction in loaf volume in yeasted white breads.",1325,99,1,0,99,0,1,0,2,2,103
"Pigs were fed three diets containing different mill fractions from oats-oat flour, rolled oats, and oat bran. The molecular weight of the (1-->3)(1-->4)-beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan) in diets and from the jejunal contents of the pigs was determined by size exclusion chromatography. There was no significant difference in the molecular weight (MW) of the beta-glucan in the diet, regardless of origin. MW was reduced 7-35-fold after passage through the stomach and the proximal small intestine of pigs, oat bran being least affected. Depolymerization toward a specific MW range of about 100 000 was seen in some digesta samples, indicating cleavage at randomly distributed susceptible bonds. The oat fractions themselves had some capacity to degrade beta-glucan, but this was insufficient to account for the MW loss during digestion. Degradation also took place when isolated beta-glucan was incubated with jejunal digesta from pigs fed an oat-free diet. Fractionation of the digesta by ultracentrifugation showed that the degrading activity was mostly associated with the supernatant. Since autoclaved digesta were without effect, the activity was presumably enzymatic, originating from microbes present in the gut. Neither isolated beta-glucan nor crude extracts from oat bran were sensitive to trypsin, indicating that cleavage of peptide bonds was not responsible for the reduction in molecular weight and loss of viscosity in digests from pigs.",1326,0,99,0,-1,0,0,1,3,1,214
"Oat bran concentrated with respect to both soluble and insoluble dietary fibre was fed to adult rats, and its effects on serum cholesterol and liver fat infiltration were studied. The feeds contained 15, 30 or 45 g beta-glucan/kg, except in control groups where the fibre of the feed was cellulose. Half the experimental groups received the feeds with an addition of 10 g cholesterol and 2 g cholic acid/kg in order to create an hypercholesterolaemic condition. In normocholesterolaemic rats the concentrated oat bran did not cause any significant changes in serum cholesterol concentrations, but reduced liver weight compared with control group rats fed on the cellulose-containing diet. In hypercholesterolaemic rats the concentrated oat bran reduced serum total cholesterol and increased high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. The effect was seen already at the 15 g/kg concentration of beta-glucan, the higher doses tested did not significantly improve the effect. Infiltration of fat into liver cells, especially in the periportal areas, was observed only in hypercholesterolaemic animals. The fat infiltration was accentuated in proportion to the amount of oat-bran concentrate fed.",1327,0,1,0,-1,1,2,1,2,0,176
"Two avenanthramides belonging to a group of about 40 cinnamoylanthranilic acid derivatives in oat grains were isolated: N-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy-(E)cinnamoyl)-5-hydroxyantranilic acid (A1) and, not previously reported, N-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy-(E)-cinnamoyl)-5-hydroxy-4-methoxyanthranilic acid (A2). The antioxidative capacities of the two avenanthramides, A1 and A2, were determined by measuring the oxygen consumption in a linoleic acid system. Al had approximately 20% of the activity exerted by alpha-tocopherol and A2 had approximately 60%. Caffeic and ferulic acid, known to be antioxidative, had much lower activities: 6 and 4%, respectively. A1 was preferentially located in the outer part of the grain. It seems to be quite heat stable, at least when located within the oat tissue during steam treatment. A comparison of 10 different cultivars of oats revealed that the amount of A1 varied between 40 and 132 mug per gram of grain. The amount of A2 is at least 10 times lower.",1328,-1,1,1,0,99,2,1,1,1,143
"Rat weight gains and feed efficiencies from diets of extruded oats (with husks), barley (with husks), or wheat were no different than those from raw grain diets. Animals that were fed extruded grains had lower serum and liver cholesterol levels than those fed the raw grain and control (casein-based) diets. Of the raw grain diets, only the barley diet had a hypocholesterolemic effect when compared to the control diet. Rats fed extruded barley had lower serum and liver cholesterol than any other grain-fed group. Factors contributing to the greater hypocholesterolemic effects of barley diets could be the higher total and soluble beta-glucan contents and higher viscosities of the barley diets versus the oat, wheat, and control diets. Diet viscosity was negatively correlated with serum (r = -0.7906, P = 0.0013) and liver(r = -0.7937, P = 0.0015) cholesterol.

"Ten Penicillium and Aspergillus species, four with a strong musty off-odor and six reference fungi without any characteristic odor, were cultivated on oatmeal agar for 5 days in cultivation vessels provided with an inlet and an outlet for air. Samples of volatile metabolites were collected on a porous polymer adsorbent attached to the outlet from day 2 through day 5 after inoculation. Adsorbed compounds were desorbed thermally and analyzed with GC/MS and a combined GC and sensory analysis, the GC sniff technique. Multivariate analysis of GC/MS and fungal odor data revealed strong associations between 6 of 65 volatile compounds and musty off-odor. The GC sniff technique showed that five of these, dimethyl disulfide, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-methylisoborneol, and two C11H18 compounds, had prominent off-odors. In addition, geosmin, 1-methoxy-3-methylbenzene, and methylphenol were produced in large amounts by some off-odorous fungi and contributed to their unpleasant odor. 3-Methylfuran, 2-methyl-1-propanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol were much more commonly produced than the off-odorous compounds.

"The effects of bran and starchy endosperm fractions of oat and rye on faecal weight and on biliary and faecal bile acids were studied in Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). The animals fed on diets supplemented with steam-flaked oat bran, oat bran ar rye bran had higher wet and dry weights of faeces compared with the animals fed on the fibre-free or low-fibre endosperm diets. A higher mean percentage of biliary cholic acid and a lower mean percentage of chenodeoxycholic and lithocholic (LCA) acids was observed in the bran-supplemented dietary groups. Animals fed on the bran-supplemented diets had increased daily faecal excretion of both total saponifiable and total free bile acids compared with the animals fed on fibre-free or endosperm-supplemented diets. The mean percentage of total saponifiable bile acids in the faeces was higher, and that of free bile acids lower in the animals fed on bran-supplemented diets. A significantly lower concentration of faecal free LCA was observed in the animals fed on the rye-bran diet. Both bran and endosperm diets reduced the faecal LCA:deoxycholic acid compared with the fibre-free diet, but the bran diets had a more pronounced effect than endosperm diets.",1332,1,0,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,193
"The digestibility of polysaccharides and other major components and the metabolic response of the microflora in the small and large intestines to oat diets varying in mixed linked B(1-->3; 1-->4)-D-glucan (beta-glucan) were studied in experiments with ileum-cannulated pigs. The oat fractions for diets were prepared in a dry milling process in which oat groats were milled into two endosperm fractions (oat flour 1 and oat flour 2) and oat bran. The digestibility of polysaccharides and the metabolic response of the microflora were followed for the two contrasting diets, oat flour 1 and oat bran, from ingestion to excretion while the digestibility of oat groats and oat flour 2 were estimated only at the ileum and in faeces. There was no degradation of beta-glucan from either oat flour 1 or bran in the stomach and the first, middle and distal thirds of the small intestine (average digestibility approximately 0), while in the terminal ileum digestibility increased to 0.30 to 0.17 respectively. The digestion of starch in the first third of the small intestine was lower for the high-beta-glucan oat-bran diet (0.49) than for the low-beta-glucan flour diet (0.64). However, digestibility differences between the two diets levelled out as the digesta moved aborally in the small intestine and the digestibility at the terminal ileum nas almost complete (0.970-0.995) for all diets. Oat non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) were an easily digestible energy source for the microflora in the large intestine less than 13% of dietary NSP being recovered in faeces. The bulk of beta-glucan which survived the small intestine was degraded in the caecum and proximal colon while arabinoxylan was more slowly degraded. The amount of residues passing the ileo-caecal junction has little impact on the density of micro-organisms in the large intestine, which on the flour and bran diets were in the range of 10(10)-10(11) viable counts/g digesta, but a high impact on the activity of the flora in colon.

"The present experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that ageing modifies the gastrointestinal responses to a change in diet composition. Rats of the Wag/Rij strain, either young adult (4 months of age) or elderly (27 months of age), were given a basal semi-purified diet or a diet of similar major nutrient composition containing 500 g oatmeal/kg for 17-18 d. Elderly rats digested the dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) of both diets less well than did their young adult counterparts, with more of this digestion occurring in the distal intestine. The greater flow of OM to the caecum of oats-fed animals was accompanied by significant reductions in caecal pH and increases in caecal total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration which appeared to be independent of age. However, young adults responded to feeding on oats by showing a much larger increase in the molar proportion of butyrate (332%) than did elderly animals (79%). Elderly rats had longer duodenal villi than did young adults but effects of age or diet were not detectable at other sites. With both age-groups oats consumption was associated with significant stimulation of crypt cell proliferation rate (CCPR) in the small intestine and caecum, but for the colon there nas a significant reduction in CCPR with oats feeding. A reduced ability of the aged large bowel (LB) to produce butyrate may contribute to the prevelance of LB disorders in the elderly.",1334,0,0,1,99,1,2,0,2,1,235

Digesta volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were similarly lower with OB + and OB -, but were significantly lower with JS- and WB- than in the corresponding coprophagy+ group. In all groups digesta butyrate concentrations were reduced by coprophagy prevention. Pools of total VFA, acetate and butyrate in the digesta were highest with JS. Pools of total VFA in digesta were highest with JS +, OB + and OB - and lowest with WB + and WB -. The propionate pool was highest with OB , intermediate with OB +, and equally low in all other groups. The pool of butyrate was highest with JS + and lowest with OB-.

"The cholesterol-lowering activity of a beta-glucan-enriched barley fraction (GEB) (fed at several levels), milled dehulled whole barley, stabilized rice bran, oat bran, and 1:1 dietary fiber combinations of GEB with rice bran or oat bran, and rice bran with cat bran was investigated in 0.25% cholesterol-fed hamsters. All diets contained 10% total dietary fiber (TDF), 9.0% fat, and 3.1% N, except one GEB diet with 13.9% TDF. beta-Glucan levels of the cereal diets ranged from 0.8 to 6.0%. After 21 days, total plasma cholesterol was significantly reduced by oat bran, the rice bran-oat bran combination, and the 13.9% TDF GEB diets as compared with the cellulose control diet. The ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to total plasma cholesterol was maintained. Liver cholesterol was significantly reduced in hamsters by all test diets, except dehulled whole barley. The viscous property of diets containing cereal fractions suggests that plasma cholesterol-lowering by oat bran and GEB (13.9% TDF) may result in reduced absorption or reabsorption of lipids, bile acids, and their metabolites.",1338,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,168
"Digestibility of polysaccharides and other macronutrients and the metabolic response of the microflora in the large intestine to a low dietary fiber wheat flour diet and three enriched diets with equal amounts of added dietary fiber (oat bran, a beta-glucan-enriched oat fraction and insoluble oat residues) were studied in ileal-cannulated pigs. The digestibility of starch was high in the small intestine (98-100%). At this site of the gastrointestinal tract there was also a significant degradation of mixed linked beta(1 --> 3;1 --> 4)-D-glucan (beta-glucan) (45-54%), whereas arabinoxylan was quantitatively recovered in ileal effluent. Type and amount of polysaccharides passing the ileal-cecal junction had little effect on the density of microorganism in the large intestine (approximately 10(10) viable counts/g digesta) but did have a high impact on the activity of the flora in colon as measured by the concentration of ATP in digesta. The relative proportion of butyrate in the short-chain fatty acids in the luminal contents of the large intestine was 6.6-8.4% when the low dietary fiber wheat flour diet was fed. However, when either oat bran or insoluble residues were included in the diet, the level was raised to 9.3-11.2%. No effect was seen after the addition of the beta-glucan-enriched fraction. This study showed that arabinoxylan and not beta-glucan in the cell walls of oat bran was responsible for the enhanced butyrate production of oat bran.",1339,99,1,99,0,1,2,0,1,2,227

The extraction procedure involved: (a) alkaline treatment of flour and removal of starch residue; (b) isoelectric precipitation of protein residue [namely, protein concentrates (PC)]; (c) and alcohol precipitation of oat gum/beta-glucan and collection of pm by centrifugation. Extracted oat pm ranged from 2.99-6.28% for oat bran and 1.82-5.24% for rolled oats whereas beta-glucan (in gum) ranged from 70-89% and 50-68%, respectively. Protein contents of the PC from oat bran was 69-91% and rolled oats 66-89%. Correspondingly, starch content of residues ranged from 30-63% and 61-87%. Oat gum/beta-glucan extracted at pH 9.2/50-degrees-C or pH 10.5/50/55-degrees-C showed little or no starch contamination.",1342,0,1,99,1,1,3,0,1,1,134

This study compared the effects of rice bran and oat bran in eleven human subjects with moderately-high blood cholesterol levels. In a 10-week controlled feeding trial, subjects consumed 100 g/day stabilized rice bran or 100 g/day oat bran for two 3-week periods in a crossover design. Prior to each bran phase, a control diet without bran was provided for 2 weeks. Total cholesterol levels decreased 7.0% when subjects consumed rice bran or oat bran. The decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in LDL-cholesterol. HDL- and VLDL-cholesterol, in addition to triglycerides were not significantly changed by either bran source. Rice bran was equally effective as oat bran in lowering blood cholesterol levels.",1344,1,-1,1,1,99,3,1,0,1,132
"Grain of 12 oat and 30 barley genotypes, each from three locations, was analyzed for tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The objective was to assess the variation in levels of tocols among genotypes and locations. Significant genotype differences existed for most tocols in both species. Total tocol concentrations for genotypes ranged from 19 to 30 mg kg-1 for oats and from 42 to 80 mg kg-1 for barley. Location differences were significant for oats but not for barley. Only a small percentage of the variance was associated with the interaction of genotype and location. Alpha-Tocotrienol and alpha-tocopherol were the predominant tocol isomers in both species; beta- and gamma-tocotrienol were also present in significant amounts in barley. The major isomers of barley, but not of oats, were generally positively correlated with each other. The data indicate the feasibility of attempting to increase tocol concentration in these crops by hybridization and selection. That could lead to food products that might lower serum low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.",1345,-1,-1,1,1,-1,2,3,0,0,174
"The influence of three pseudoplastic hydrocolloids, oat gum. guar gum and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) on sensory perception of sweetness and flavour was studied in model systems at two viscosity levels. The sweeteners studied were sucrose, fructose and aspartame, the flavour substances ethyl caproate, a-pinene and cinnamic acid. Sweetness was best perceived from oat gum solutions and most weakly from guar gum solutions. The effect of the composition of the thickener on the perception of sweetness was greater than that of viscosity. Reduction of sweetness by hydrocolloids was weaker for aspartame than for fructose or sucrose. In the perception of flavours. both the total length of perception and the time-intensity pattern were more dependent on the model aroma substance than on the thickener. Possible explanations for the differences are discussed.",1348,1,99,0,0,99,1,0,2,2,129
"Scales that categorize the development of cereal apex have been introduced by several authors. Daylength markedly affects the rate of apex organogenesis and, hence, numeric codes for developmental stages of apices introduced for lower latitudes cannot be used in Finland without modifying them into a ratio scale. The present study introduces numeric codes that categorize the 22 developmental stages of oat (Avena sativa L.) apex in the growing conditions of Southern Finland. Field experiments, including 14 oat cultivars and six breeding lines that differ in the duration of the period from initiation of double ridges to pollination, were carried out at the Viikki Experimental Farm of the University of Helsinki (60-degrees 13'N) for two years. The numeric codes were established by relating them to cumulated degree days (CDD). This study showed that when estimating the developmental stages of oat apex by calculating CDD from sowing, the error of estimation was +/-1 stage unit at the most.",1349,0,99,0,99,99,0,0,2,3,156
"Beta-glucan was extracted and purified from Tupper barley bran (6.6% beta-glucan), Azhul barley bran (13.4% beta-glucan), and commercial oat bran (6.9% beta-glucan) with solvent 1 and, in the case of Azhul barley bran, with two additional solvents (2 and 3). Solvent 1 was distilled water adjusted to pH 10 with 20% sodium carbonate, solvent 2 was distilled water adjusted to pH 7, and solvent 3 was 4% (w/v) sodium hydroxide. Solvent 1 extracted 61-64% of the total beta-glucan from the barley brans and 70% from oat bran; solvents 2 and 3 extracted 72 and 84%, respectively, from Azhul barley bran. The final yields, in percent beta-glucan recovered from barley brans, were solvent 1, 52-55%; solvent 2, 40%; solvent 3, 81%. The yield from oat bran with solvent 1 was 61%. The purified preparations contained 72-81% beta-glucan + pentosans from barley brans and 84% from oat bran, expressed on an ash-free basis. They also contained 0.2-0.5% total nitrogen, 0.4-1.2% starch, 1.1-10.9% pentosans, and 3.7-12.6% ash. Ether extract was not detected in any of the preparations. Enrichment index, calculated by percent yield X (percent beta-glucan + pentosan, ash-free basis)/100, was highest for solvent 3 (65), lowest for solvent 2 (33), and varied from 38 to 51 for solvent 1. Sodium hydroxide (solvent 3) appeared to be a better solvent for extraction and purification of beta-glucan from barley bran.

The saponin content was significantly different (P<0.05) between the oat cultivars and ranged from 0.020 to 0.050% with a mean of 0.040% (dry matter basis). There was no significant correlation between lipid and saponin content. Milled oat kernels were separated into fractions according to particle size. The fractions with the smallest particle sizes had the highest concentrations of saponins. Thus, the oat kernel saponins seem to be situated mainly in the endosperm.",1351,99,99,0,0,99,0,0,2,3,98
"A method for analysis of oat kernel saponins is presented. The saponins were extracted from defatted oatmeal with methanol for 24 h in a Soxhlet apparatus. Separation of the saponins was accomplished by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an octyl-silica column and gradient elution with acetonitrile in water. Two main peaks, avenacoside A and B, were detected. The identification was achieved by comparing retention times and photodiode array UV spectra with those of an avenacoside A and B standard preparation from oat leaves. The identity of the avenacoside A and B peaks was further supported by incubation of oatmeal suspensions in water, after which the retention times were shifted to those obtained with the corresponding desglucoavenacoside standard.

"Amylodextrins with soluble beta-glucan contents as high as 10% were prepared from milled oat flours and bran. The level of enzymatic conversion was measured by high performance liquid chromatography and gel permeation chromatography. The large molecular weight amylodextrin fragments containing the beta-glucan from low level amylolytic conversions were measured by gel permeation chromatography. The different elution times of the two separate enzyme conversion mixture components suggest different modes of enzyme actions. Lower molecular weight fractions are produced by the action of Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase in contrast to the action of B. stearothermophilus alpha-amylase, due possibly to dissimilar enzyme dosages. Comparisons of the amylodextrin compositions produced by B. stearothermophilus alpha-amylase and B. licheniformis alpha-amylase systems at intermediate conversion levels revealed that the B. stearothermophilus alpha-amylase gave much larger quantities of the maltohexaose component than the B. licheniformis alpha-amylase.",1353,0,0,99,0,0,0,0,4,1,137
"The effects of beta-glucan-rich oat bran on serum lipids and lipoproteins were examined in a randomized 8-week study. After a 4-week run-in phase, subjects with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia [serum total cholesterol (TC) 5.5-8.5 mmol/l] on cholesterol-lowering diets were randomly allocated to an oat bran (10.3 g beta-glucan/day) or wheat bran group. Thirty-six subjects (20 in the oat bran group, 16 in the wheat bran group) completed the study. The diet was identical in both groups during the trial and no significant changes in body weight were found. Serum TC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) significantly declined in the oat bran group during the first 4 weeks from 7.03 +/- 0.81 to 6.72 +/- 0.97 (p = 0.028) and from 4.90 +/- 0.69 to 4.61 +/- 0.89 mmol/l (p = 0.038), respectively, but at 8 weeks the values were not significantly different from baseline. Changes in serum TC were mainly confined to those who ate at least two-thirds of the planned daily dose of oat bran. In wheat bran group no changes were observed in serum TC or LDL-C levels. Apolipoprotein A1 and B did not change significantly in either group. Only subjects with apolipoprotein E 3/3 phenotype (n = 12) had hypocholesterolemic response to oat bran at 4 weeks, but no change was found in those with apolipoprotein E 4/4 or 4/3 (n = 7). The results suggest that the hypocholesterolemic effect of oat bran may diminish with time, and that in subjects with apolipoprotein E 3/3 phenotype, oat bran induces a more marked decline in LDL-C than in those with apolipoprotein E 4/4 or 4/3.",1354,0,1,99,-1,0,1,1,2,1,267
"traction from untreated bran gave higher viscosity than beta-glucan preparations isolated from the concentrates. The viscosity and molecular weight of beta-glucan was reduced at acidic conditions under concentration and by trypsin. beta-Glucan from a cold-water, wet-milled concentrate had the highest molecular weight and also higher hydrodynamic volume than beta-glucan isolated from the other concentrates. In rats fed diets containing 3.3% beta-glucan from oat bran fiber concentrates but no added cholesterol or cholic acid, the serum total cholesterol level was lowered by 30% with the ethanol-water, wet-milled concentrate and by 10% with the cold-water, wet-milled or hydrolyzed concentrate, relative to the initial cholesterol levels and to the levels of the control group receiving cellulose in the diet.

"Serum cholesterol-lowering effects of oat bran-enriched diets have been indicated in several studies in which oat bran was given several times a day. Concomitant changes in the daily diet, ie, a diminished energy intake or changes in the composition of fats in the diet, also have been reported and used to explain the hypocholesterolemic effect of oats. The present study was designed to replace only the conventional continental breakfast by a single oat bran cereal muesli containing 60 g of oat bran and to measure the effects of this dietetic modification on serum lipids in 13 patients with hypercholesterolemia type IIa. Compared with a 3-week baseline period, total serum cholesterol (7.38 +/- 0.35 mmol/L, mean +/- SEM) was reduced by 10.9, 8.4, and 9.7% in the first, second, and third week of oat bran ingestion (p < .01). High-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as apolipoprotein A1 decreased to the same extent (8 to 11%; p < .05) during the oat bran period, whereas a pronounced reduction of 25.8% was seen for apolipoprotein B100 (p < .01), which is a major component of low-density lipoprotein. Dietary data obtained by 3-day food records at baseline, oat bran, and follow-up period did not show any differences between the study periods except for dietary fiber, which was increased from 21.9 g/day to 42.4 g/day (p < .002) during the test period because of the daily oat bran intake. On the basis of these results the simple replacement of a conventional continental breakfast by an oat bran cereal muesli can be highly recommended to lower total serum cholesterol and other atherogenic lipid fractions in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa.",1357,99,1,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,277
"The yield of water soluble non-starch polysaccharides (WSNSP) prepared from whole grains of wheat, rye, triticale, barley and oats was 0.6, 1.8, 0.7, 1.2 and 1.0% respectively of the dry matter. The WSNSP from wheat, rye and triticale contained mainly pentoses (74, 86 and 81% respectively of the total monosaccharides), while in the WSNSP of barley and oats glucose (74 and 69% respectively of the total monosaccharides) was the main monosaccharide. All the WSNSP samples contained some amount of protein (7% in rye-WSNSP to 18% in triticale-WSNSP) attached to their low molecular weight fractions as observed in the gel permeation chromatographic separation. The major amino acids in these samples were aspartic and glutamic acids. No hydroxyproline was found in these samples. Their water binding capacity determined as the amount of unfreezable water using differential scanning calorimetry showed that the WSNSP of wheat, rye, triticale, barley and oats was 0.41, 0.47, 0.42, 0.49 and 0.44 g/g dry matter respectively. The WSNSP of wheat and barley showed higher emulsifying capacities determined as the amount of oil emulsified by one gram of the sample in water. The intrinsic viscosity of the water solutions of these non-starch polysaccharides shows a direct relation to their molecular weight and their simha shape factors indicated that all the samples were of an extended shape. However, the intrinsic viscosity of the water solution of rye-WSNSP was significantly higher than that of wheat, triticale, barley and oats.",1358,1,99,-1,0,99,1,1,1,2,238
"Oats were wet-fractionated into fiber, starch, and protein fractions under different pH conditions, and lipid contents and compositions were determined in each fraction. In a process utilizing water without a pH adjustment, the accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) was a characteristic feature so that they constituted up to 6 %, 18 %, and 27 % of total lipids in fiber, starch, and protein fractions, respectively. In contrast, in an alkaline process initially adjusted to pH 9 or above, the FFA levels were close to that found in dry oat meal. When the fractions from the alkaline process were dried and resoaked in nonadjusted water, no lipid hydrolysis was found, while in fractions from the corresponding process in nonadjusted water FFA contents rose to 14 %, 44 %, and 77 % in the fiber, starch, and protein fractions, respectively. It is therefore concluded that lipid deterioration associated with oat processing and storage of the products so obtained can be favorably affected by slightly alkaline fractionation conditions.",1359,99,0,1,99,99,1,0,1,3,166
"The positional and fatty acid selectivities of oat (Avena sativa L.) seed lipase (triacylglycerol hydrolase EC 3.1.1.3) were examined. Pure triacylglycerols were used as substrates. The products of lipolysis were examined by thin-layer chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography. Only symmetrical triacylglycerols were used as substrates; thus potential complications arising from stereo-bias were avoided. Controls were carried out with a lipase specific for primary positions. The lipase from oat seeds catalyzed the hydrolysis of both primary and secondary esters. When the lipase was tested upon mixtures of homoacid triacylglycerols (triacylglycerols composed of the same three fatty acids), the lipase acted most rapidly upon those containing oleate, elaidate, linoleate and linolenate. Strong intermolecular selectivity against homoacid triacylglycerols containing palmitate, petroselinate and stearate was observed. Comparison of assays performed at 26-degrees-C with those performed at 45-degrees-C showed that selectivity was temperature-independent. When mixed-acid triacylglycerols containing both oleate and stearate were treated with lipase, intramolecular selectivity was observed, with oleate hydrolysis predominating. From this work and earlier work, it can be concluded that the selectivity exhibited by the oat seed lipase is similar to that of the lipase from Geotrichum candidum, except that the oat seed lipase attacks elaidate, a fatty acyl group with a trans double bond, whereas the G. candidum lipase strongly discriminates against elaidate.",1360,0,-1,0,99,1,1,1,2,1,212
"The gastrointestinal (GI) effects of three different dietary fibre (DF) sources: wheat bran (WB), oat bran (OB) and pea fibre (PF), were compared with a low-fibre diet in a 4-week trial with rats (initial body-weight 210 g). The DF sources varied widely in chemical composition, solubility and water-holding properties, and particle size. The DF sources were mixed into diets to comprise the same amount of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP; 135 g/kg dry matter (DM)). Compared with the control diet, all fibre-containing diets reduced apparent digestibility of DM, energy, and protein significantly but to different extents. The ranking order of faecal DM bulking followed that of NSP recovery in the faeces: WB > OB > PF > control. The elongating effect of the diets on the GI tract was most pronounced in the rats fed on the OB diet. The mean transit time (MTT) of the OB diet was similar to that of the control diet (approximately 37 h). which was significantly slower than the MTT of the WB and PF diets (approximately 23 h).

"Oat starches isolated from three groat types containing different amounts of lipid (6.2, 8.0, and 15.5%) were analyzed for protein, lipid, and phosphorus contents and characterized by iodine affinity, gel permeation chromatography, scanning electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). All oat starches contained greater amounts of lipid, phosphorus, and amylose (30-34% by iodine affinity) than did starch from most other native cereal grains reported in the literature. Preliminary results from gel permeation chromatography revealed a large amount of the low-molecular-weight starch fraction, a fact suggesting the existence of intermediate molecular-weight starch. As determined by scanning electron microscopy, the oat starches had small, irregularly shaped granules 3-10 mum in size. As determined by DSC, the starches exhibited gelatinization onset temperatures differing significantly by starch type (ranging from 55.5 to 62.4-degrees-C), gelatinization enthalpies ranging from 2.05 to 2.20 cal/g, and a high amylose-lipid peak.

The concentrate was baked in bread which was consumed for 8 weeks by free-living men with mild to moderate hypercholesterolaemia. The effects on serum lipids were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Despite the large daily dose (11.2 g) of beta-glucan, the beta-glucan-enriched bread had only a small and statistically non-significant effect on serum lipid concentrations. Probable reasons for the weakness of the effect could be the poor solubility of beta-glucan in the preparation, its enzymatic hydrolysis after ingestion, and the consequently low viscosity in the intestine.",1364,-1,0,99,0,0,0,1,3,1,117
"The effects of sterilization and oat bran enrichment of pasta on the glucose and insulin responses in healthy subjects were evaluated. Cooked and canned spaghetti and cooked fettucini without and with enrichment with oat bran (28%) were compared. Further, the effects of various low- and high-temperature drying conditions for spaghetti, cooking time and sterilization on the starch digestion rate and content of enzyme-resistant starch (RS) in vitro were also studied. Various cooking quality data were also determined to allow interpretation of results. The incremental glucose area (0-120 min) produced by canned spaghetti was twice the area of that produced by cooked spaghetti (69.03 vs 35.45 mmol/l x min, P < 0.01). The incremental insulin area (0-120 min) was also significantly higher with canned spaghetti (17 500 vs 12 600 pmol/l x min, P < 0.05). The rapid digestion was caused by excessive swelling of starch during sterilization that promoted a very soft texture of the spaghetti. Enrichment of fettucini with oat bran reduced slightly the incremental insulin area (15600 vs 20 100 pmol/l x min, P < 0.05, for 0-120 min), but did not significantly reduce the glucose area. Drying conditions and cooking times could be varied within broad limits without affecting the rate of starch digestion in vitro of cooked spaghetti. In sterilized spaghetti the content of resistant starch was higher than that found in cooked 'al dente' spaghetti (2.2-3.4 vs 0.5 mg/100 mg total starch). In conclusion, sterilization influences the nutritional properties of starch in pasta by substantially increasing the glucose and insulin responses and by formation of resistant starch. The effect of oatbran environment is restricted mainly to a slight decrease in the insulin response.",1365,1,99,99,1,0,2,0,1,2,278
"The effects of consuming an increased amount of soluble fibre as oat bran or beans were examined in 40 free-living hypercholesterolaemic men and women.

Body weight and overall composition of the diet did not change. Plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were unchanged. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was significantly higher on all three intervention diets than on the lower fibre run-in diet. Supplementation of a moderately low-fat diet with palatable quantities of oat bran or beans without changing the overall fat intake does not appear to significantly lower cholesterol but may have a benefit by increasing HDL-C and reducing the ratio of LDL-C to HDL-C.",1366,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,3,0,151

"Mechanisms for the hypocholesterolemic effects of oat bran remain unclear. Soluble fibers such as oat bran are fermented in the colon to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which may enter the portal vein and attenuate hepatic cholesterol synthesis.

Oat bran decreased serum cholesterol 12.8% (P < 0.001) whereas wheat bran had no effect. Peripheral serum SCFA concentrations were measured seven times over 14 h at the end of each diet. Serum acetate values from 1200 to 2200 were significantly higher in subjects fed oat-bran vs wheat-bran diets. Peak and incremental peak acetate values were also significantly higher than control values in subjects fed oat bran but not in subjects fed wheat bran.

"The lipase activity in oat kernels at different pHs, at different stages of development, and in different parts of the oat kernel was studied. The measurement of lipase activity was performed by means of fluorescence spectrophotometry. Lipase activity was higher in the aleurone layer and embryonic tissues than it was in the starchy endosperm. This also was shown in flour samples from fractionated milling. In accordance with the lipase distribution found in the oat kernel, the lipase activity was highest in flour fractions close to the superficial bran layer and was lowest in the internal endosperm fractions. The development of lipase activity during germination of the seeds caused an increase in the activity at neutral and alkaline pH, whereas the activity at acid pH remained relatively constant. This indicated that the lipase activity at alkaline pH was more related to the metabolic processes initiated by the growth of the embryo. Three different Swedish cultivars were analyzed. Lipase activity varied only slightly and was not correlated to fat content. Lipase inactivation was studied in model laboratory studies.

Four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets consisting of a control, 15% NHOB, 30% NHOB, and 30% BOB were fed for 28 days. Oat bran was baked under moisture and heat conditions simulating dough preparation and bread-making. BOB had higher insoluble fiber (mainly beta-glucans and Klason lignin), lower total phytate, and diminished levels of highly phosphorylated inositols. NHOB feeding reduced Ca availability and impaired absorption of mineral Ca. Magnesium absorption and retention (percent of intake) were lower in the NHOB groups; due to compensation of Mg output by NHOB intake, daily Mg absorption and retention increased. Fe, Zn, and P showed higher daily absorption and retention in the NHOB groups. As compared with NHOB, ingestion of BOB resulted in lower Ca and Fe availability and had no effect on Zn and P; daily Mg absorption and retention were not affected.",1372,1,0,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,167
"To reduce phytate in oat products and thereby increase mineral bioavailability, optimal conditions for phytate degradation in oats were investigated. The effects of malting and incubation on phytate reduction in oats were determined and compared with phytate degradation in wheat, rye and barley. Studies of incubation temperatures showed an optimum for phytate reduction in oats between 37-40-degrees-C which differed from that in wheat (55-degrees-C). Malting of oats for 5 days at 11-degrees-C and subsequent incubation for 17 hr at 37-40-degrees-C reduced phytate by 98%. Addition of malted rye also reduced the phytate content of oats to low levels.",1373,1,99,99,99,99,1,0,0,4,98
"The effects of the addition of 15% or 30% non-heated oat bran or 30% baked oat bran to a purified diet on apparent digestibility of dry matter, protein, lipid and fiber were measured in balance experiments with male Wistar rats. The effects of oat bran on dietary metabolizable energy, fecal bulking capacity and transit time of the ingested food were also studied. Heat processing of oat bran occurred in conditions of moisture and temperature similar to those of bread baking. Compared with the unprocessed oat bran, the baked product had a higher content of insoluble fiber, mainly due to higher Klason lignin content and a shift from soluble to insoluble beta-glucans. Relative to the fiber-free control diet, feeding the oat bran diets increased wet and dry fecal weight and decreased the transit time of the food. Fecal bulking capacity increased proportionally with oat fiber intake. Metabolizable energy of the diets, as well as apparent digestibility of dry matter and protein decreased with oat bran supplementation; on the other hand, lipid digestibility was not significantly changed. Baking of oat bran resulted in no statistically significant effects on dietary metabolizable energy or apparent digestibility of dry matter, protein, lipid and fiber. The measured metabolizable energy of oat bran ranged between 12.7 and 13.2 MJ/kg. Total plasma cholesterol concentration diminished with oat bran intake; nonheated and baked oat bran had comparable effects on plasma cholesterol. An inverse linear relationship (r = -0.80, P < 0.1) was found between plasma cholesterol concentration and fecal excretion of bile acids.",1374,0,1,0,1,-1,2,1,2,0,254
"To compare the effects of oat-bran fiber on blood lipids, we studied 84 healthy middle-aged men and women who were placed on metabolic diets, for 2 wk, that were supplemented with either wheat bran (n = 42) or oat bran (n = 42). Fiber supplementation was 1.6 ug dietary fiber/J (6.8 g dietary fiber/ 1 000 kcal) to a maximum of 16.4 g fiber/d. Significantly greater decrease with oat than with wheat were seen in total cholesterol (0.56 +/- 0.08 mmol/L and 0.29 +/- 0.08 mmol/L, P = 0.022) and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (0.39 +/- 0.07 mmol/L and 0. 1 5 +/- 0.07 mmol/L, P = 0.024). No significant differences were seen in high-density lipoprotein, apolipoproteins A-1 and B, or triglyceride. We conclude that oat bran has an advantage over wheat bran in lowering serum lipids when tested in metabolic diets on large numbers of individuals with an initial mean serum cholesterol concentration above the desirable range, at 5.61 +/- 0.16 mmol/L.",1375,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,2,0,161
"Oat starch was isolated from oat flour by 1) high shear in water after a presoak, 2) low shear after digestion with protease, and 3) low shear at alkaline pH. Oat flour was soaked in water (25% solids) at 20-degrees-C for 6 hr and subjected to high shear using a tissue homogenizer. After 1 min of shearing followed by centrifugation, the yield of starch (1.3% protein) was 70%, based on oat flour. Two bases were used to isolate oat starch at different concentrations and stirring times. Stirring for 60 min at pH 10.5 with 0.01 M sodium hydroxide (pH 10.5) or 0.03 M calcium hydroxide (pH 11.0) led to 72-75% isolated starch with 0.3% protein. Digestion of oat flour (25% solids) with Aspergillus oryzae protease at pH 7.5 and 37-degrees-C for 6 hr gave 78% starch with 1.1% protein. Oat starch isolated with sodium hydroxide showed a delayed pasting temperature and increased paste consistency in the amylograph compared to starch isolated by high shear or calcium hydroxide.

When the reaction was done in 0.48 M NaOH and 2.43 M Na2SO4, the DS of the product was 0.042. In the calcium ion system, reacting beyond 8 hr at 35-degrees-C, 3 hr at 40-degrees-C, or 24 hr at 25-degrees-C caused gelation of the mixture. Cationic oat starch, corn starch, and wheat starch, all with DS of approximately 0.013, improved the dry strength of paper handsheets to a comparable degree.

"Ground meal of two barley cultivars, Waxbar (WXB) and Prowashonupana (PWSNP), was compared with oat bran (OB) and wheat red dog (WRD) for their cholesterol-lowering effects in chicks and rats. Total beta-glucan, total dietary fiber (TDF), and soluble dietary fiber were 16.9, 33.4, and 18.1% for PWSNP; 7.9, 15.0, and 8.3% for WXB; 6.6, 16.6, and 6.9 for OB; and 2.6, 35.0, and 4.1 for WRD. In both chicks and rats, OB and WXB demonstrated a significant (P < 0.05) lowering effect on total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not decreased. Compared with controls, the WRD diet increased serum cholesterol in chicks and had no effect on rats. PWSNP did not lower cholesterol levels in the rat experiment but did in the chick experiment (P < 0.05). In rats, a high fiber level of WXB and OB (10% TDF) was more effective than a lower level in reducing total and LDL cholesterol. Soluble beta-glucan appeared to be the strongest predictor of the serum cholesterol response in both species. Barley grain can offer a high-fiber, cholesterol-lowering alternative to OB. Further research is required to clarify inconsistencies in lipid responses among animals fed different barley cultivars.",1378,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,200
"Oat lines (102 total) grown in 1989 and 1990 were analyzed for beta-glucan by flow injection analysis (FIA) to determine the influence of variety and growing season on beta-glucan contents. The correlation between FIA and the AACC enzymatic method for measuring beta-glucan content was 0.97. The average coefficient of variation for the FIA measurements per sample was 1.2%, and the oat lines showed a normal distribution for beta-glucan contents in both years, ranging from 3.0 to 6.5% in 1989 and from 3.9 to 6.4% in 1990.

"Formulations were developed for muffins containing high levels of cereal fiber, using fiber sources that have hypocholesterolemic and/or hypoglycemic properties. Oat bran, a high beta-glucan barley fraction, or rice bran replaced the wheat flour in a traditional recipe, at levels of 100, 40, and 60%, respectively. Muffins were rated as acceptable, according to hedonic-scale ratings given by consumer panelists who also evaluated an oat bran muffin prepared from a commercial mix. The experimental muffins supplied more than 7 g total dietary fiber in a large (100 g) muffin, compared to about 3 g in the commercial oat bran muffin. High-fiber muffins contained more moisture, protein, and minerals (ash) and fewer calories than the commercial muffin. As measured by the rate of in vitro starch digestion, all muffins had relatively low glycemic properties similar to whole cooked grains and pasta products.",1380,1,1,99,1,0,3,0,1,1,140
"The effects of oat bran and wheat bran on plasma lipid concentrations were compared in a crossover study. Each bran (123 g oat bran or 54 g wheat bran) added nearly 18 g of nonstarch polysaccharide to a background diet containing about 10 g nonstarch polysaccharide. Twenty-three men (average plasma cholesterol level = 5.84 mmol/L, and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level = 4.11 mmol/L) were randomly assigned to either the oat or wheat bran diet for 4 weeks and then changed to the alternate bran diet for a similar period. The oat bran diet produced significantly lower levels of plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol: 5.65 +/- 0.16 and 3.88 +/- 0.15 mmol/L (mean +/- standard error) for oat bran vs 5.89 +/- 0.16 and 4.11 +/- 0.16 mmol/L for wheat bran Food intake diaries showed that average consumption of total fat and saturated fat was identical during the two test periods, which excluded displacement of fat as an explanation for lowering of plasma cholesterol by oat bran. Our results indicate that in mildly hypercholesterolemic men, a diet high in soluble oat fiber can significantly lower plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and thus potentially lower the risk of coronary heart disease.",1381,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,201
"Experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanisms by which some sources of dietary fiber reduce accumulation of liver cholesterol in rats fed a cholesterol-containing diet. Male Wistar rats were fed a semipurified diet containing no fiber (sucrose replacing dietary fiber) or 15% cellulose, alfalfa or whole ground oats as a source of dietary fiber with and without 0.25% cholesterol added. Serum and liver cholesterol level, liver HMG CoA reductase activity, and fecal bile acid and neutral steroid excretion were measured after 21 days. Serum cholesterol levels were not different in any of the diet groups. In cholesterol-fed rats, alfalfa resulted in a reduction in the level of liver cholesterol accumulation in comparison to cellulose or the fiber-free diet but oats did not. Daily bile acid and neutral steroid excretion were increased in response to cholesterol feeding but little difference was observed among the groups fed the various dietary fiber sources except that alfalfa resulted in lower excretion rates compared to other fiber-containing diets. HMG CoA reductase activity was reduced by cholesterol feeding and was significantly increased in response to alfalfa in the absence of dietary cholesterol. The relative amounts of bile acids excreted was altered both by cholesterol feeding and by the source of dietary fiber. Cholesterol feeding resulted in an increase in the amount of chenodeoxycholic acid derivatives excreted, especially in the 6-beta-hydroxylated, muricholic acids. Dietary fiber appeared to increase the contribution of chenodeoxycholic and lithocholic acids to the resultant increase in response to dietary cholesterol. These changes in the relative amounts of bile acids excreted in response to this cholesterol challenge are suggested as a partial explanation of the reduction in accumulation of liver cholesterol in rats in response to dietary cholesterol.",1382,1,1,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,284
"Oat starches representing two different isolation methods were studied for lipid contents and compositions. One of the starch isolation methods utilized water and the other slightly alkaline solution. The internal lipids were practically identical in both starches. However, starch from the alkaline method contained 21% less non-starch lipids as total fatty acids, 63% less Kjeldahl nitrogen, and the content of non-starch free fatty acids was low. Instead, starch from the water method contained almost three fold higher amounts of free fatty acids which contributed up to 49% of non-starch lipids. Therefore, it was concluded that isolation of starch under alkaline conditions both reduces the content of non-starch lipids and maintains a better composition in the residual starch lipids.",1383,99,99,99,99,99,0,0,0,5,118
A nitrogen balance study of 10 infants five to 18 months old compared two infant formulas containing amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus) with a soy-oats formula. Analysis of covariance techniques were used to investigate significant differences between types of formula with respect to nitrogen absorption and retention. Infant weight and nitrogen intake were used as covariates in order to adjust the dependent variables to a constant level of each of these covariates. No significant differences (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) were found among the three formulas with respect to either nitrogen absorption or nitrogen retention.,1384,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,91
"Dry milling and sieving of barley and oats produced fractions that were enriched in beta-glucan [(1 --> 3), (1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucan]. Hulled and hull-less varieties of barley and defatted rolled oats and oat bran, containing less than 10% moisture, were ground and sieved with a 325-mesh screen (45-mu-m openings). Coarse material retained by the screen was reground and resieved. The resulting coarse fraction, with a weight yield of 18-30%, contained 16-27% total beta-glucan. Further sieving of this beta-glucan-rich fraction with a 100-mesh screen (147-mu-m openings) yielded fractions representing 1.7-16.5% of the kernel weight and containing up to 28% total beta-glucan. The water-soluble beta-glucan was about 55% of the total beta-glucan for all test materials except Wanubet barley, in which soluble beta-glucan ranged from 60 to 70% of the total beta-glucan. Dry milling and sieving techniques can be used to prepare barley and oat fractions with beta-glucan concentrations 2.4-4.9 times those of the original grain.",1385,1,1,1,99,1,4,0,0,1,154
"High concentrations of fecal bile acids are associated with a higher incidence of colon cancer. Dietary changes that alter bile acid metabolism are therefore of interest. Here, we report the effect of feeding diets containing four fiber sources and two fat levels for 7 wk on bile acid excretion and small intestinal bile acids (an index of pool size) in rats. The fiber sources were oat bran, rye bran, barley bran and sugar beet fiber. Fiber-containing diets were 8% dietary fiber and contained either 5 or 20% corn oil. All fiber sources caused significantly greater fecal output compared with the fiber-free basal diet. All fiber sources also resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) lower fecal bile acid concentration compared with the fiber-free basal diet. Only rye bran resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) higher total fecal bile acid excretion. Oat bran resulted in a slightly but significantly (P < 0.05) higher quantity of small intestine bile acids compared with the other diets. Dietary fat level had no significant effect on fecal bile acid concentration or excretion or quantity of small intestinal bile acids. We conclude that all four fiber sources tested resulted in lower fecal bile acid concentration, by effectively causing greater fecal mass. Changes in dietary fat level as corn oil had no effect on fecal bile acids.",1387,1,1,0,1,-1,3,1,1,0,219
"Fractionated samples of (1 --> 3),(1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucans from oat aleurone ('oat bran') with a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution were characterized by total intensity light scattering. Typical Zimm plots showed that for each concentration the angular dependence could be fitted with a straight line. For each angle, however, the concentration dependence showed a distinctive curvature and the negative second virial coefficient typical of a reversibly aggregating system. The shape of the Zimm plots was the same at increased temperature (60-degrees-C) in different solvents (1 mol/dm3 aqueous LiI, 4 mol/dm3 aqueous urea and dimethylsulfoxide) and after ultracentrifugation (300 000 g for 4 h). The extrapolated data at zero concentration and zero angle nevertheless yielded weight average molecular weights (M(w)) in the same range as the osmometric number average molecular weights (M(n)) determined previously. The relationship between the root-mean-square z-average radius of gyration (R(g)) and M(w) was found to be R(g) (nm) = 0.03 x M(w)0.59 in good accord with expectation from polysaccharides of similar structure and consistent with earlier realistic molecular modeling of these beta-D-glucans. A cooperative, closed association model is described, and it is shown that the apparent M(w) obtained at different concentrations from the light scattering data at zero angle can be closely fitted with the M(w) calculated from the model, assuming that multimers consisting of 4-5 unimers are formed. This model predicts-in contrast to experimental observation-a strongly negative osmotic second virial coefficient. A refined aggregation model in which only a fraction of the unimers are assumed capable of involvement in association to form large, cooperatively stabilized aggregates fits both the present light scattering and the earlier osmotic pressure data quite satisfactorily.",1388,0,0,1,-1,99,1,1,2,1,274
"The beta-glucan content in the groats of different Finnish oat varieties cultivated in Finland varied from 3.2 to 5.3% and, in the fibre concentrates obtained by dry milling and a further concentration step including hot ethanol treatment and wet milling, from 11.8 to 18.3%. The viscosities of the isolated crude extracts varied widely between the varieties. Stil, Puhti, Yty and Nasta formed the most viscous solutions and Pol, the typical feed oat, the least viscous solution. The more significant differences in the viscosities between the oat varieties when measured at the same beta-glucan concentration could be explained in terms of differences in mean molecular weight. Trypsin decreased the viscosity and the molecular weight of beta-glucan of all samples. The viscosity of the beta-glucan solutions was independent of pH both before or after enzyme treatment indicating that the protein or peptide is firmly bound to beta-glucan.",1389,99,99,0,-1,99,0,1,1,3,145
"Barley was partially replaced with either rapeseed oil (RSO), unextracted steam-exploded birch wood (W1) or extracted steam-exploded birch wood (W2), and fed to 10 lactating cows (5 multiparous and 5 primiparous cows) in comparison to rolled barley and oats. The experiment was designed in two balanced 5 x 5 Latin squares. The experimental periods lasted for 4 weeks and the cows were fed with a fixed amount of 8 kg (air dry basis) concentrate in two equal portions. Timothy dominant unwilted grass silage was provided ad libitum. The nutrient digestibility, blood metabolites, milk yield and composition were studied. Grass silage intake decreased by replacing barley with RSO and increased with W1 and W2. Oat feeding also increased silage intake compared to barley feeding. Oat feeding decreased the digestibility of the organic matter (OM) compared to barley. No significant difference was observed between diets in plasma concentrations of insulin, free fatty acids, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucose. Replacing part of the barley with RSO increased milk yield by 1.3 kg and 0.87 kg compared to oats and barley feeding, respectively. Replacement of barley by low energy birch wood decreased milk yield. Both RSO and oat feeding decreased milk protein content. Milk urea concentration was elevated by oats and depressed by RSO and birch wood. RSO and oat feeding decreased the short chain fatty acid content of milk, with a concomitant increase in stearic and oleic acids.",1390,1,-1,1,99,99,2,1,0,2,234
"The nutrient digestibility and protein utilization of undehydrated barley fractions: protein (BP), protein fibre mixture (BPF) and distillers solids (DS) at two levels of inclusion in diets fortified to equal lysine content were assayed with growing pigs in a 6 x 6 Latin square. Dried barley fibre (BF). oat protein (OP) and oat fibre (OF) from integrated starch-ethanol production were evaluated as feed ingredients for pigs in three other trials, DS and OP had a higher essential amino acids content than BP, especially with respect to lysine. All fractions had a rather high ether extract content 46-196 g/kg and their fatty acid composition is presented. BP showed higher protein digestibility than DS (0.931 vs. 0.857) and pigs on BP-diet retained more N than on DS-diet. BF showed a low digestibility of OM and CP and 0.1 inclusion of BF mixed with BP depressed CP digestibility and N-retention. A higher protein supply from cereal protein in the diet promoted N-retention but decreased protein utilization. OP had high digestibility and OF was more digestible than BF. The study confirmed the high digestibility and energy values of the proteinous grain fractions and a high protein utilization when adequately fortified with lysine. The fibrous fractions have a rather low nutrient digestibility and their use in pig diets is therefore limited.",1391,-1,1,1,0,1,3,1,1,0,216
"Six normolipidemic males ingested on separate days a low-fiber test meal [2.8 g dietary fiber (TDF)] containing 70 g fat and 756 mg cholesterol, enriched or not with 10 g TDF as oat bran, rice bran, or wheat fiber or 4.2 g TDF as wheat germ. Fasting and postmeal blood samples were obtained for 7 h and chylomicrons were isolated. Adding fibers to the test meal induced no change in serum glucose or insulin responses. The serum triglyceride response was lower (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) in the presence of oat bran, wheat fiber, or wheat germ and chylomicron triglycerides were reduced with wheat fiber. All fiber sources reduced chylomicron cholesterol. Cholesterolemia decreased postprandially for 6 h and was further lowered in the presence of oat bran. Serum apolipoprotein (apo) A-1 and apo B concentrations were not affected. Thus, dietary fibers from cereals may reduce postprandial lipemia in humans to a variable extent.",1392,0,1,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,151

"Fluorescence microscopy was used to study the microstructure of oat cell walls during concentration of oat bran and isolation of beta-glucans. The bran concentrate separated from c.v. Nasta contained mainly the aleurone and subaleurone endosperm layers, whereas that separated from a commercial bran mixture contained more endosperm. In contrast to Nasta, the commercial bran mixture contained beta-glucan degrading enzymes, which survived the beta-glucan isolation procedure. In the presence of enzymes, the solubility and yield of beta-glucans improved but the viscosity decreased when it was measured at the same beta-glucan concentration. For inactivation of the enzymes, 80% ethanol at 78-degrees-C was more effective than 80% or 94% ethanol at 60-degrees-C or 94% ethanol at 78-degrees-C. The yield of beta-glucan extracted was higher from Nasta bran concentrate than from commercial bran concentrate, and after alkaline extraction the Nasta solid residue exhibited intense red fluorescence in the aleurone and subaleurone endosperm cell walls.

"Oat flours prepared from hulled, dehulled, or heat-treated grains were studied for lipid changes in aqueous suspensions. These data were compared to lipid profiles of fiber, protein, and starch fractions obtained in a wet fractionation process. The appearance of free fatty acids (FFA) at the expense of triglycerides (TG) but not their rapid oxidation was a response to water soaking of the flours; the lipids of hulled and dehulled grains were neither hydrolyzed nor oxidized under similar conditions. Wet fractionation of oat flour from nonheated grains resulted in TG hydrolysis in starch and protein fractions so that FFA content rose to 21% and 30%, respectively, while the lipids of fiber remained very similar to that of whole grains. Since TG, polar lipid, and FFA fractions in whole grains comprised about 78%, 19%, and 3% of total lipids, very little of the oat's original lipid composition prevailed in the starch and protein fractions. Therefore, prevention of lipid hydrolysis rather than oxidation should be a primary goal in the manufacture of nondeteriorated oat products.",1395,0,1,1,1,99,3,0,1,1,172
"The effects on rumen degradation of chemical and physical treatment of oats and barley were investigated by use of the in-sacco technique. Whole oats (75 % DM) were treated with 0, 30 and 50 g NaOH, 30 g NH3 or urea per kg DM. Three different strengths of NaOH (11, 22.5 and 45 % w/v) were tested at the 30 g kg-1 DM level. Oat hulls and crushed, shelled-crushed and shelled-whole oats were also tested, with or without addition of NaOH. Whole barley was subjected to a pearling treatment, removing 7, 11 and 18 % of the DM, mainly hulls. A part of the pearled barley was also steeped in cold water for 8 h. All pearled samples were reconstituted before in-sacco incubations. Barley was also 'clipped' into pieces or crushed manually, using a hammer. All samples were incubated for variable amounts of time up to 24 h (48 h for oat hulls). Oat samples were analysed for DM, NDF, ADF and lignin and barley samples for DM, NDF and starch. To compare the effects on rumen pH and ammonia-N, two rumen fistulated cows were fed 50 % hay and either 50 % whole NaOH-treated oats (30 g NaOH kg-1 DM) or crushed oats. In-sacco results showed that whole oats treated with 3 or 5 % NaOH had 24 h DM degradation of 61 % and 68 %, respectively, compared with 7 % for the untreated oats. Extra water additions with the NaOH had no significant effect. Shelled oats were degraded more (85 %) at 24 h than whole oats treated with NaOH (max 68 %), NH3 (30 %) or urea (22 %). Alkali treatment had no additional effect on the shelled oats. Crushing gave the most rapid degradation for both whole and shelled oats. However, treatment with NaOH after crushing reduced degradation. Only 10 % DM of the hulls were degraded at 48 h, but treatment with 5 % NaOH increased this value to 55 %. In the rumen study, mean rumen pH was similar for both diets, but pH variation was smaller and ammonia level consistently higher after feeding NaOH-treated oats.

"Broiler chickens were fed diets based on oat bran or oat bran that had been extracted with ethanol in order to remove tocotrienols and other ethanol-soluble components. The diets were fed ad libitum with and without a supplementary fibre degrading enzyme, except for the enzyme-supplemented diet based on oat bran which was fed at a restricted level equal to the intake of chickens fed the corresponding unsupplemented diet. Enzyme supplementation dramatically improved chicken live weights and feed conversion efficiencies and also feed intake for those fed ad libitum. Chickens fed the unsupplemented diets had low and similar serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations whereas birds fed enzyme-supplemented diets had higher serum cholesterol concentrations. Results obtained indicate that, in the present study, the dietary fibre (mainly soluble mixed-linked (1-->3), (1-->4)-beta-D-glucans) had a greater influence on serum cholesterol concentrations than tocotrienols and other ethanol-soluble components, which were effectively extracted by the procedure employed. The importance of meal frequency was also demonstrated by the high triglyceride and serum cholesterol concentrations obtained for chickens fed on a restricted basis.",1397,1,-1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,174
"Mammalian tissue DNA has recently been found, via P-32 postlabeling, to contain complex profiles of age-dependent bulky carcinogen adductlike covalent modifications, which have been termed I-compounds, referring to their apparent indigenous origin without exposure to exogenous carcinogens. I-compound patterns are highly species, sex, tissue, and diet specific. As shown here, the presence of certain plant ingredients in diet, ie., ground oats and alfalfa meal significantly contributed to the formation of these DNA derivatives. Six groups of weanling female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed one of the following diets for three months: a natural ingredient diet containing neither oats nor alfalfa (Wayne MRH 22/5 Rodent Blox), Wayne diet supplemented with oats or alfalfa or both, a purified semisynthetic diet (AIN-76A), and AIN diet supplemented with oats. The natural ingredient diet produced more complex patterns and higher levels of I-compounds than purified diet in both liver and kidney DNA. Supplementation of either diet with oats elicited the formation of four additional oats-specific I-compounds in liver DNA. Oats and alfalfa, individually and in combination, tended to significantly raise nonpolar and diminish polar I-compound levels. To determine whether the oats-related extra spots were derived from mycotoxin contamination, two groups of rats were fed either Wayne diet or Wayne diet containing zearalenone (0.05 mg/kg) for three weeks. Zearalenone significantly increased the uterine weight but did not induce any DNA adduct formation. These findings establish a novel link between specific natural food ingredients and carcinogen adductlike DNA derivatives and may provide a model to investigate events occurring at the juncture of nutrition, metabolism, gene expression, aging, and cancer.",1398,-1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,0,261
"Metabolic balance studies were conducted in adult human males to investigate the effect of oat bran on the nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and zinc balance, on the intestinal absorption of calcium and on the endogenous fecal calcium, using 47CaCl2 as the tracer. A 40-d control period preceded a 32-d experimental period in which subjects consumed four oat bran muffins daily as part of a constant metabolic diet. No significant changes in the calcium, magnesium or zinc balances were observed, but the nitrogen and phosphorus balances increased. The net or apparent absorption of nitrogen, magnesium and phosphorus expressed per milligram of intake increased significantly in the oat bran period due to the added content of these nutrients in the oat bran muffins. The intake of the oat bran muffins led to a significant increase in urinary phosphorus and significant decreases in urinary calcium and 47Ca excretions. The intestinal absorption of calcium, determined with 47Ca, did not change, whereas the endogenous fecal calcium increased slightly but significantly.",1399,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,3,0,165
"The effects of increasing quantities of oat bran on plasma lipids were examined in 40 hypercholesterolemic men and women. Using a four-by-four Latin-square design, subjects added 30, 60, and 90 g oat bran/d or no oat bran to their usual diet for 1-mo experimental periods. Self-selected background diets remained unchanged and weight did not change significantly. No differences in plasma total or low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were found. Supplementation of the usual diet with less-than-or-equal-to 90 g oat bran does not appear to significantly lower cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic subjects continuing to follow a diet relatively high in saturated fatty acids.",1400,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,2,3,0,98
"The degradation of dietary fiber from hard red spring (HRS) wheat, corn, and oat brans (respectively 25.7, 18.4, or 22.7% in diets) was studied in rats after 28 weeks of feeding. In animals fed the oat bran diet, 76 +/- 9% of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was fermented. Although dietary fiber levels and compositions were similar in HRS wheat and corn bran diets, HRS wheat NDF showed greater fermentative degradation (particularly xylan) than corn NDF (31 +/- 3 vs 7 +/- 4%) (P < 0.001). Dietary fiber degradation observed by fluorescence microscopy was negligible in corn bran, partial in HRS wheat aleurone layer, and extensive in oat aleurone layer, confirming NDF analysis. It is concluded that bran fiber fermentability cannot be predicted from its composition alone.",1402,99,0,0,0,-1,0,1,3,1,126
"Two amylases from fungal and bacterial source were added to oatmeal suspensions in concentrations varying from 0.0125 to 0.64%. Changes in viscosity, phase angle and elastic modulus during heating were followed together with sedimentation and flow properties. The complete pasting behavior could be followed without sedimentation problems. The hydrocolloidal properties of beta-glucans appeared to be important. The bacteria/enzyme reduced peak viscosity much more rapidly than the Fungamyl enzyme at low concentrations. The flow properties of a Fungamyl treated oat meal suspension with the peak viscosity reduced > 90% were pseudoplastic.",1403,99,99,99,0,99,0,0,1,4,90
"The hypocholesterolemic effects of oat bran (OB) have been recently challenged. To carefully document the hypocholesterolemic effects of OB, 20 hypercholesterolemic men admitted to a metabolic ward were randomly allocated to either OB or wheat bran (WB) for 21 d after a 7-d control-diet period. Control and treatment diets were designed to be identical in energy content and nutrients, differing only in the amount of soluble fiber. After 21 d, OB significantly decreased total cholesterol by 12.8% (P < 0.001), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol by 12.1% (P < 0.004), and apolipoprotein B-100 by 13.7% (P < 0.001) whereas WB had no significant effect. High-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I did not change significantly in either group. Serum triglycerides decreased by 10% in both groups but the decrease was only significant (P < 0.04) in WB subjects. OB but not WB significantly reduced total cholesterol and other atherogenic lipoprotein fractions independent of other dietary changes.",1404,1,0,1,1,-1,3,1,1,0,151
"Whole meal, bran, and flour from three barley genotypes, which contained graded levels of soluble fiber, were compared with similar commercial fractions of oats for their effect on blood cholesterol (CH), triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) CH, and liver CH (test model, using hypercholesterolemic rats). Whole meals of the three barley genotypes contained 3.0, 5.2, or 6.8% soluble fiber; oatmeal contained 3.0%. In meal-fed rats, barley genotypes did not show a favorable blood or liver lipid response compared with oats. However, in bran- and flour-fed rats, the data showed that barley exerted a profound blood and liver CH-lowering effect compared with oat bran or flour (blood triglyceride levels were minimally affected). Blood HDL-CH levels were appreciably elevated in rats fed barley bran or flour compared with oat bran or flour. These results suggested that barley and its major fractions (bran and flour) may evoke different lipidemic responses and that barley bran and flour have a more favorable effect on blood lipids than do oat bran and flour.",1405,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,166
"Studies in humans and rats show that oat bran lowers serum cholesterol whereas wheat bran does not. In contrast, wheat bran is more protective against experimentally induced colon cancer than is oat bran. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a combination of oat bran and wheat bran could both lower serum cholesterol and positively affect colon physiology. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats (12 per group) were fed sufficient fiber from oat bran and wheat bran to result in the following amounts and combinations of dietary fiber in their diets: 1) 4% from oat bran + 4% from wheat bran (4 + 4); 2) 6% from oat bran + 2% from wheat bran (6 + 2); 3) 4% from oat bran only (4 OB); 4) 4% from wheat bran only (4 WB). Results were compared to a control supplemented with 8% cellulose. The diet with the highest amount of oat bran (6 + 2) resulted in the lowest serum cholesterol value (143 +/- 5 mg/100 ml), which was significantly lower than the control (180 +/- 17) and 4% from wheat bran only (4 WB) (230 +/- 10, [P < 0.01]). Similar amounts of oat bran resulted in similar cholesterol values despite the presence of wheat bran: 157 +/- 5 (4 + 4) compared to 161 +/- 5 (4 OB). In the colon, the addition of wheat bran to the oat bran diet did not mitigate the fermentative effects of oat bran, even though wheat bran was a better bulking agent, assessed by a greater fecal dry weight (4.29 +/- 0.21 g for 72 hr compared to 3.63 +/- 0.21 g, [P < 0.01]), probably due to a higher proportion of insoluble fiber. This study shows that adding wheat bran to oat bran does not negate the positive effects of the latter on serum lipids. However, neither does it overcome the negative effects of oat bran on colon physiology.",1407,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,320
"A polydisperse sample of mixed-linkage (1 --> 3),(1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucans from oat aleurone was fractionated by conventional size exclusion chromatography on semipreparative columns of Sepharose CL 4B and 6B to produce fractions of low polydispersity. The fractions were characterized by their intrinsic viscosities and their number-average molecular weight. The HPSEC-chromatograms of the beta-glucan fractions suggested very narrow molecular weight distributions in all fractionated samples. From knowledge of the relative weights of the fractions and by assuming that each fraction was strictly monodisperse, the weight and number-average molecular weight of the unfractionated sample of beta-glucan were determined to be 71 900 and 49 000, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the number-average molecular weight determined by osmometry (55 000). The Mark-Houwink-Sakurada viscosity equation for. monodisperse beta-glucans was determined for samples having molecular weights from 26 x 10(3) to 137 x 10(3) g/mol as [eta] = 6.7 x 10(-2) M(n)0.75BAR (in ml/g) (20-degrees-C, 0.1 mol/dm3 NaCl). The beta-glucan fractions were further characterized by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography, and compared with commercially prepared pullulan fractions of low polydispersity and alginate fractions obtained in another study in this laboratory. The validity of the universal calibration procedure was tested with the three different polysaccharides, showing the same linear relationship between hydrodynamic volume ([eta] x M) and elution volume for all three polysaccharides. The commercial pullulan samples seemed well-suited for calibration purposes.",1409,99,0,99,99,1,1,0,1,3,224
"Rolled-oat porridge was prepared by conventional and microwave cooking to determine and compare the effects of these cooking methods on the texture, viscosity, and amounts of dispersed gelatinized starch and solubilized (1 --> 3)(1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan). The porridge prepared by microwave cooking was generally more grainy and less viscous than that prepared by the conventional method. Microwave cooking produced relatively less dispersed gelatinized starch and less solubilized beta-glucan than did conventional cooking. The difference was slight with short cooking duration (1 min) but increased drastically with prolonged cooking (20 min). Thicker oat flakes (regular-cooking rolled oats) released less solubilized beta-glucan and gelatinized starch than did thinner oat flakes (quick-cooking rolled oats) upon cooking. Microscopic examination revealed that the two cooking methods had different effects on the structural organization of oats. Rolled oats prepared by microwave cooking contained starch granules that were smaller in volume and less convoluted in structure than those conventionally cooked. Furthermore, the cell wall of the former was less disrupted. These differences may have been due to the effect of stirring; the microwave-heated rolled oats were stirred relatively less than were the conventionally cooked samples.",1411,1,1,1,99,0,3,0,1,1,189
"Samples of commercially prepared oat bran were obtained from four oat milling companies and used to develop calibrations for soluble, insoluble, and total dietary fiber, protein, and starch, using a near-infrared reflectance (NIR) scanning spectrophotometer. The Mongeau method (J. Food Sci. 51:1333, 1986) was used as a reference method for the fiber components. Calibrations were developed using conventional regression and regressions involving principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). Accuracy and precision of NIR predictions were adequate for quality assurance for all five constituents. Conventional and PCA/PLS regressions were not significantly different from each other in their ability to provide satisfactory calibrations. The weightings computed during development of PCA/PLS regressions may be useful in providing information about the factors affecting variance in composition.",1412,1,1,99,99,99,2,0,0,3,125
"Foods containing soluble dietary fibers delay glucose absorption and lower postprandial plasma glucose. This effect of oat bran has been attributed to oat gum (80% beta-glucan). However, purified oat gum has previously not been available for human studies. In this study the glucose and insulin responses to consuming 14.5 g of specifically prepared oat gum with 50 g glucose were compared with the response to guar gum with glucose and to glucose alone in nine healthy, fasting subjects. Plasma glucose and insulin increases after the glucose drink were greater than after both gum meals between 20 and 60 min (P < 0.01). The responses to the two gum meals were nearly identical. These results establish that the more palatable oat gum lowers post-prandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in humans and may be comparable with or of greater benefit than guar gum.",1413,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,142
"Eight separate solvent systems were used with groats and hulls of several lines of oats to determine which system resulted in the most effective, rapid extraction of antioxidants. Antioxidant activity at room temperature was estimated by using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) along with a beta-carotene spray. The greatest antioxidant activities were obtained with methanolic antioxidant extracts derived from Noble and Ogle oats and hulls. These extracts were added to soybean oil (SBO) and their effectiveness was compared with that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), tertiary butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) and a control (no additives) at 32-degrees-C, 60-degrees-C and 180-degrees-C. A petroleum ether extract of Noble oats also was tested in SBO at 180-degrees-C. Peroxide values (PV) for oils with added antioxidants during storage at 32-degrees-C and 60-degrees-C showed that the Ogle oat extract was more effective than the other oat and hull extracts or the control. There were no significant differences in effectiveness among the extracts and the control at 60-degrees-C. At 180-degrees-C, the stability of each oil was determined by measuring conjugated dienoic acid values (CD) and the relative amounts of the unoxidized fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) 18:2, 18:3 and 18:2/16:0. All oils with added oat and hull extracts had significantly lower CD and significantly higher 18:2/16:0 than oils with added BHT, TBHQ or the control during 14 days at frying temperature. Phenolic and hydroxy-phenolic antioxidant compounds with acids, alcohols, sugars or glycerides attached were tentatively identified in the oat and hull extracts by using TLC and chromatographic sprays.",1414,0,1,0,99,0,1,0,3,1,248
"In adult male rats fed on a cholesterol-free synthetic diet, plasma cholesterol concentrations were lowest with oat bran, intermediate with cellulose and highest with wheat bran. Plasma triacylglycerols (TAG) were similar with wheat bran and cellulose but higher with oat bran. The concentrations and pools of caecal volatile fatty acids (VFA) were lowest with cellulose and equally higher with oat bran and wheat bran. Plasma VFA concentrations in the hepatic portal vein reflected those in caecal digesta and were unrelated to plasma cholesterol. Feeding oat bran after extraction with n-pentane gave plasma cholesterol concentrations similar to that found with wheat bran. Reconstitution of oat bran with extracted lipids did not restore the cholesterol-lowering effect. Addition of the extracted material to a wheat-bran diet had no effect on plasma cholesterol. Plasma TAG were higher with the oat bran and reconstituted-oat-bran diets than with wheat-bran or cellulose diets. However, extracted oat bran + safflower oil gave similar TAG concentrations to that with wheat bran. These extractions and additions did not change caecal bile acid or neutral sterol concentrations. Effects of these diets on plasma cholesterol were unrelated to their tocotrienol or tocopherol content. Addition of n-pentane to oat bran followed by evaporation of solvent gave plasma cholesterol concentrations that were significantly higher than untreated oat bran but lower than similarly treated wheat bran. It is concluded that oat bran affects cholesterol metabolism through a pentane-soluble component as well as non-starch polysaccharides. It appears that the activity of this lipid is not transferable by simple addition of the solvent extract to the whole diet.",1415,0,-1,1,1,-1,2,2,1,0,261
"Oat products rich-in water-soluble fiber improve glucose metabolism and lower serum cholesterol. To examine the safety, tolerance, and metabolic effects of a water-insoluble oat-hull fiber, eight lean men with non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes consumed a traditional diabetes diet for one week, followed by a control diet plus 30 g/day of insoluble oat fiber for two weeks in a hospital metabolic ward. On discharge, the subjects resumed their normal diet plus 30 g/day of insoluble oat fiber for an additional 10 weeks. The oat fiber was well accepted and produced no serious side effects. The hospital oat-fiber diet decreased fasting serum glucose levels by 13% (P < 0.05), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 8.9% (P < 0.05), and apolipoprotein B-100 by 17% (P < 0.01). Other serum lipid levels did not change significantly, and values returned to pretreatment levels during the ambulatory phase. Insoluble oat fiber may have beneficial metabolic effects in persons with type II diabetes, but further research is required to clarify these effects.",1416,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,164
"This study measured dietary compliance and attitudes of 68 hypercholesterolemic men and women who were randomly assigned to one of the following diet regimens: (1) low fat, low cholesterol diet; (2) low fat, low cholesterol diet + 50 g/day oat bran; (3) 50 g/day oat bran supplemented diet; and (4) 42.5 g/day processed oat bran supplemented diet (ready-to-eat cereal with an increased beta-glucan content). Attitudinal and compliance scores were the most positive for those on the processed oat bran, followed by those on fat-modified regimens, while subjects on the unprocessed bran scored their diet regimen the most negatively. Dietary compliance decreased significantly over the 12-week study period for the fat-modified groups, compared with the adherence to the bran-supplemented regimens for which compliance did not appreciably decline. The fat-modified lifestyle, however, was reported as much more likely to diffuse throughout the family than the use of oat supplements, despite encouragement and provision of additional bran earmarked for this purpose. These findings support past research that the addition of a food to the diet is met with less resistance than food restriction, if the added food is familiar, convenient and palatable.",1417,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,189
"The present work was undertaken to study the gastrointestinal effects of wheat and oat dietary fibre (DF) using 40-50 kg pigs cannulated in the terminal ileum. The variables studied were: chemical characteristics of the DF, ileal and faecal digestibility of nutrients and bulking properties of polysaccharides and other major constituents. The wheat products studied included refined wheat flour and wheat fractions rich in the following botanical components: aleurone, pericarp/testa and bran. The oat products used were rolled oats and oat bran. The products varied considerably in DF content (g/kg dry matter) and composition; non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and Klason lignin content ranged from 34 and 1 g/kg respectively in wheat flour, to 465 and 92 g/kg in pericarp/testa. The main NSPs in the wheat were arabinoxylans (AX) (64-69%) and cellulose (15-31%) and in oats mixed linked beta(1 --> 3; 1 --> 4)-D-glucans (beta-glucans; 46-63%) and AX (28-32%). The lowest content of soluble NSP was found in the lignified wheat fractions (bran and pericarp/testa) and the highest in oat bran. Eight diets were produced using the wheat and oat products and studied in two series of experiments using wheat flour as the DF-depleted control. The diets in Expt 1 were based on wheat flour and three iso-DF enriched diets prepared by adding DF from the fractions rich in wheat aleurone, pericarp/testa or bran. In Expt 2, oat bran was added to wheat flour to achieve the same DF intake level as in Expt 1. This series also included diets based on rolled oats and rolled oats plus oat bran. Starch was almost completely digested in the small intestine (0.97-1.00). However, there was a tendency to a slightly lower digestibility of oat starch compared with wheat starch. The recovery of wheat NSP in ileal digesta was 82-104% compared with 64-66% for oats. The low recovery of NSP in oat diets was primarily due to the low recovery of beta-glucans (25-36%). In the large intestine NSP and starch residues were extensively degraded. For the DF-deplet",1418,0,99,1,1,1,3,0,1,1,331
"The present work was undertaken to study the microbial activity in various segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of pigs as influenced by the source and level of wheat and oat dietary fibre (DF). Eight experimental diets were prepared from wheat and oat fractions and studied in a series of two experiments using wheat flour as the DF-depleted control. The diets in Expt 1 were based on wheat flour and three iso-DF enriched diets comprising fractions rich in wheat aleurone, pericarp/testa or bran. In Expt 2, oat bran was added to wheat flour to achieve the same DF intake level as in Expt 1. This series included further diets based on rolled oats and rolled oats plus oat bran. The eight diets were given to thirty-two ileal-cannulated pigs, with sixteen pigs in each experiment. After a total period of 34 d (Expt 1) and 42 d (Expt 2), the pigs were slaughtered 4 h post-feeding and samples taken for adenine nucleotides (adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP); adenylate energy charge (AEC)), organic acids (lactic acid (LA); short chain fatty acids (SCFA)) and pH at twelve sites of the GI tract. The microbial activity as measured by the ATP concentration was low in the stomach and the cranial two-thirds of the small intestine, but tended to increase in the distal third. In the caecum a sharp rise in microbial activity was observed; the highest level was found for the diet providing most fermentable substrates. In all the diets but the rolled oats + oat bran diets, microbial activity showed a descending pattern as the digesta moved through the colon. In the large intestine source and level of residues had a marked influence on microbial activity. LA was the chief organic acid in the stomach and small intestine (10-40 mmol/l) while LA relative to SCFA was a minor component in the caecum and colon (10-20 mmol/l). The contribution of SCFA to total organic acids was reciprocal to LA, i.e. low in the stomach and small intestine (< 20 mmol/l) and high in the caecum and colon.

"A new group of phenolic acids was found in aqueous alcoholic extracts of both oat groats and hulls. These acids occurred as conjugates covalently linked to the amine function of several different orthoaminobenzoic acids. One of the conjugates was a pale yellow crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 325 (C18H15NO5). Mass spectral studies revealed an acid composed of C11H10O3 and a molecular weight of 190. Structural analysis (H-1-, C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet, etc.) allowed formulation of the acid as 5-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-penta-2,4-dienoic acid (i.e., 4'-hydroxycinnamylidene-acetic acid), for which the trivial name avenalumic acid is proposed. Comparison of proton coupling constants of the naturally occurring conjugate with models suggests that the oat constituent is an interconvertible mixture of the 2-E,4-E and 2-Z,4-E isomers, with the former isomer predominating. This assignment was confirmed by total synthesis of 2-E,4-E-avenalumic acid. Two additional derivatives of avenalumic acid were also detected: the 3'-hydroxy- and 3'-methoxy analogues. These acids, which are the ethylenic homologues of the well-known p-coumaric, ferulic, and caffeic acids, may be widely distributed in cereal grains.",1420,99,1,0,1,0,2,0,2,1,172
"Four Holstein heifers were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design to measure total tract digestion of cell wall components from diets based on alfalfa haylage and alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated oat hulls. Diets contained 90% forage and 10% concentrate. Treatments were diets containing 90, 70, 50, or 30% alfalfa haylage with treated oat hulls supplying the remainder of the forage portion. Total tract digestion of cell wall-associated uronic acids, arabinose, galactose, mannose, rhamnose, and lignin were not affected by forage source. Digestibilities of cell wall glucose and xylose increased with increasing level of dietary treated oat hulls, reflecting the positive effect of alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment on cell wall digestion. Cellulose (ADF minus acid detergent lignin) digestibilities were similar to those for cell wall glucose, whereas hemicellulose (NDF minus ADF) digestibilities were similar to those for cell wall arabinose plus xylose. Low digestibilities of alfalfa cell wall xylose indicate that some cell wall structure inhibits the degradation of alfalfa xylans. Low degradabilities of core lignin, esterified p-coumaric acid, and esterified acetyl groups suggest that these components may be involved primarily in depressing fermentation of cell wall polysaccharides.",1422,1,1,99,0,-1,2,1,1,1,189
"A simulated digestion technique was used to investigate the characteristics of starch hydrolysis in uncooked, cooked and extrusion-cooked oat products in vitro. The rate and extent of starch hydrolysis were both significantly lower in uncooked rolled oats than in the same material after brief boiling or extrusion cooking. A similar degree of maldigestion in vivo would lead to as much as an estimated 68% of oat starch entering the colon. Breath-hydrogen measurements were used to compare the fermentable carbohydrate content of uncooked and briefly boiled rolled oats in human volunteers and to estimate the relative contributions of soluble dietary fiber and undigested starch to the fermented component. Isolated oat gum (beta-glucan) was readily fermented in vivo and was apparently the main fermentable component of cooked rolled oats. Uncooked rolled oats gave a higher excess hydrogen production than cooked oats, but the results were variable and the differences not statistically significant. In an additional experiment, lactulose was used as a fermentable reference material to calculate the apparent fermentable carbohydrate content of rolled oats and oat gum. Uncooked rolled oats were estimated to contain a statistically significant quantity of undigested starch, amounting at most to 1.01 +/- 0.40 g (mean +/- SEM) of undigested starch per 50 g of fresh weight. We concluded that starch hydrolysis in oats is limited to some extent by the physical state of the food matrix, but this effect may be greatly overestimated by simulated digestion procedures in vitro.",1423,-1,0,0,99,0,0,1,3,1,242
"Oligosaccharides obtained by the action of (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-D-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase (lichenase) on the (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-D-glucan of oats (oat beta-glucan) were characterized by methylation analysis. The polysaccharide was confirmed as composed mainly of beta-(1-->3)-linked cellotriosyl and cellotetraosyl units with a small amount of regions containing 4-8 consecutive (1-->4)-linked units. C-13-Nuclear magnetic resonance data confirmed these structural features. The oligosaccharides released by lichenase were analyzed by elution with water from a Bio-Rad HPX-42A high-performance liquid chromatography column with peak detection by an automated orcinol-sulfuric acid reaction, and the ratio of tri- to tetrasaccharide was determined. This ratio defines the major structural repeating units of the cereal (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-D-glucans and may be determined without prior purification of polysaccharide. The molar ratio of tri- to tetrasaccharide determined for oats was 2.1 +/- 0.1, for barley 3.2 +/- 0.3, and for wheat 3.5 +/- 0.4. No difference was detected between the beta-D-glucan from oat brans and the whole groat.

"Eleven cultivars of oats were fractionated into coarse and fines fractions by a simple milling procedure. There were significant differences between cultivars in the (1-->3),(1-->4)-beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan) concentration of the whole groat (3.91-6.82%) and in the bran (5.81-8.89%). The average bran yield of 53.3% produced an average beta-glucan concentration in the bran that was one and a half times the concentration of the groat. Although there was a weakly significant correlation between groat beta-glucan and bran beta-glucan (r2 = 0.823), there was sufficient variation in the ratio of bran to groat beta-glucan (1.28-1.60) to observe significant changes in the ranking of cultivars for bran beta-glucan after milling. The average starch concentration of the groat (59.1%) dropped to 49.3% in the bran and was raised to 69.7% in the fines fraction. Starch was less variable than beta-glucan with a between-cultivar coefficient of variation of 4.9% in the groat and 6.9% in the bran compared with 15.9 and 13.8%, respectively, for beta-glucan.",1425,0,1,99,99,99,1,0,1,3,159
"Twelve Holstein cows, averaging 110 d postpartum, were used in three replications of a 4 x 4 Latin square design to determine the effects of feeding different amounts of alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated oat hulls on digestion and production responses.

Treatments were 0 (control), 17.2 (low), 34.5 (medium), and 52.1% (high) treated oat hulls in the diet. Dry matter intake was 24.6, 27.1, 27.7, and 26.3 kg/d for the control, low, medium, and high treatments, respectively.

"Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of inclusion of alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated oat hulls in diets on feed intake and nutrient digestion by wethers and growing heifers. In a pilot study with six wethers, we compared diets with untreated versus treated oat hulls containing 60% roughage and 40% concentrate (DM basis).

Digestibilities of DM, NDF, and ADF were increased by at least 12 percentage units, and digestible nutrient intakes increased 73 g/d for wethers fed the treated oat hull diet versus the untreated diet. Intakes of DM by heifers were 8.9, 9.4, 9.6, and 9.2 kg/d for the control, low, medium, and high treated oat hull diets, respectively.

Gains in BW ranged from .77 kg/d for heifers fed the high diet to 1.1 kg/d for those fed the medium diet. Heifers fed larger amounts of treated oat hulls had lower ruminal pH and ammonia N concentrations, higher molar percentage acetate, and greater acetate:propionate ratios than controls. Heifers fed diets containing treated oat hulls had higher digestible DM and fiber intakes than controls. Treated oat hulls have a place in diets of growing ruminants.",1427,1,0,99,99,1,2,0,1,2,257
"Broiler chickens were fed diets based on brain or inner endosperm from oats (Avena sativa L), given with or without a supplementary fibre-degrading enzyme, in order to study the effects of the dietary fibre on production results, carcass composition and serum cholesterol concentration. Enzyme supplementation of the oat-bran-based diet significantly improved production results and caused an increase in total serum cholesterol concentration and carcass fat whereas carcass crude protein and water content decreased. On enzyme supplementation of the diet based on inner endosperm, a significant although less pronounced improvement in production results was obtained. Chickens fed the inner endosperm diet generally had higher total serum cholesterol concentrations which increased further on enzyme supplementation. Carcass fat content also increased on enzyme supplementation, and at day 27 chickens fed the enzyme-supplemented diet based on inner endosperm had the highest carcass fat content in comparison with all other diets. The results show that dietary fibre exerts a greater influence on total serum cholesterol concentration than energy or fat intake since chickens fed the enzyme-supplemented oat-bran diet had the highest intake of metabolisable energy and fat but still displayed lower total serum cholesterol concentrations than chickens fed the enzyme-supplemented low fibre diet based on inner endosperm.",1428,1,1,1,1,99,4,0,0,1,202
"A commercially available enzymic method for the quantitative measurement of (1 --> 3),(1 --> 4)-beta-glucan has been simplified to allow analysis of up to 10 grain samples in 70 min or of 100-200 samples by a single operator in a day. These improvements have been achieved with no loss in accuracy or precision and with an increase in reliability. The glucose oxidase/peroxidase reagent has been significantly improved to ensure colour stability for periods of up to 1 h after development. Some problems experienced with the original method have been addressed and resolved, and further experiments to demonstrate the quantitative nature of the assay have been designed and performed.",1429,99,99,1,1,0,2,0,1,2,108
"Oat products are increasingly used in human nutrition due to the rather high content of soluble fibre. Oat products, however, have a high content of phytate which may interfere with the absorption of non-haem iron. The iron balance situation is critical in several groups, especially in children, teenagers and women in their fertile years. It is therefore important to examine the effect of oat products on non-haem iron absorption in man. The present studies showed that oat bran and oat porridge markedly inhibited the absorption of non-haem iron. The inhibition can be explained by the high phytate content of oat products. This is partly due to a high resistance of oat phytate against exogenous phytase and partly to an inactivation of the endogenous phytase in oats caused by the usual heat treatment of oats which is made to prevent rancidity of oat lipids during storage. The inhibitory effect of oat products on iron absorption is sufficiently marked to be a serious consideration if such products are more regularly consumed.",1430,-1,-1,-1,0,1,1,3,1,0,169
"Microstructural and rheological changes in barley and oat starch dispersions during heating and cooling were studied by light microscopy and dynamic viscoelastic measurements. The two starch pastes showed similar viscoelastic properties after gelatinization, but during cooling the 20% barley starch pastes heated at 95-degrees-C underwent a sharp transition in viscoelastic behaviour probably due to the gelation of amylose. This transition was shifted to lower temperatures at 10% starch concentration. Microstructural studies of an 8% barley starch dispersion heated to 90-degrees-C using the smear technique showed amylose to form a network structure around the granules. The granules in starch paste heated to 95-degrees-C were poorly stained and amylopectin was fragmented. Microscopic examination of an embedded section of the cooled barley starch gel showed amylose to form a continuous phase in which starch granules were dispersed. G' increased below 80-degrees-C during cooling of 10% oat starch dispersions preheated at 95-degrees-C. No rheological changes occurred when they were preheated at only 90-degrees-C. Microstructural studies of an 8% oat starch dispersion heated to 90-degrees-C using the smear technique showed amylose to form a network structure around the granules. Part of the granule structure had already broken down. Heating to 95-degrees-C induced considerable changes in the granule structure of oat starch gels. Amylopectin formed a very fine network. Microscopic examination of embedded sections of the cooled, stored gel showed a much coarser structure compared with that of the smear.",1443,99,1,99,1,99,2,0,0,3,234
"Near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy has been used for the rapid analysis of oats (Avena sativa). Using a closed sample population, calibrations have been developed to predict moisture in coarsely-ground oats (range 11.6-21.4%; standard error of prediction = 0.22) as well as protein and moisture in finely-ground grain (protein range 7.7-12.9%; standard error of prediction = 0.23; moisture range, 10.3-14.7%; standard error of prediction = 0.1). Prediction accuracies are suitable for trading purposes.",1444,99,99,99,99,1,1,0,0,4,72
